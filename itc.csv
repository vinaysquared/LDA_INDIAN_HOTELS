0,50,"We had visited ITC Windsor, Bangalore in end Jan 2021, deciding to have a break from our home, after a long Covid imprisonment. We contacted them before arrival and Mr Mahesh attended the call. Knowing that we are from Defence Services, he was overjoyed, and gave us a beautiful upgrade to a room with a terrace garden. He personally escorted us and showed the room and access to Terrace Garden. The Service of the hotel is par excellence. Satish Tripura was extremely helpful, served with a smile and even decorated our bed, a day before check out. And we ate and ate, since the food was so awesome. In Raj Pavilion, one of the dining areas, Mr Shiva hosted us with great attention. He kept suggesting different Menus during our 5 days stay. Chefs were wonderful and created excellent dishes for us. In fact, one evening Chef Ruby Islam asked us what we‚Äôd like for desert and offered to create a special pastry dish for each one of us, as it was indeed  a finger licking experience. Hats Off to each everyone at Windsor, for taking such good care. Seeing this awesome care by ITC Hotels, we booked ourselves for another ITC at Port Blair, Andaman Island in March. Thanks to all.‚Ä¶"
1,50,"My recent stay at ITC Windsor was absolutely amazing ! Right from the very beginning Satvik arranged everything to perfection . The room alloted was lovely , the housekeeping attendant servicing our room did a fantastic job , the team at the coffeeshop was incredible.    I owe a big thank you to each and everyone at the hotel . A special mention to Anuj who was very accommodating .  Dushyant the happiest FnB Manager I've ever come across , again extremely warm . Satvik for all his assistance and help . Chef Yash for the incredible buffet spread.    I can't wait to plan my next trip to Bangalore.  "
2,30,"Staycation is the much talked about vacation in these times. We have been exploring Bangalore hotels for the same purpose and visited ITC Windsor Manor in Jan last week of 2021. While the booking was easy, they don't have pre-check-in (they claim they have). We called twice to ask about it and ready to give details, for which they asked to send an email, which was never acknowledged. Every hotel lets you do that online (app, website or by email). Anyways, Check-in at hotel was smooth, and we were told that we are upgraded to Tower rooms. We entered the room, with excitement, and was so disappointed to see the room quality, furnishings etc. Its basically old rooms, which they have kept clean. Some rooms were getting renovated to look little modern (in terms of furnishings/lightings etc). They are short of staff, so every request took 2-3 calls to get it served (pencil/note-pad, drinking water and more).  Breakfast was good with lot of options and good taste. Hotel was crowded so they had to accommodate us at Dakshin restaurant for breakfast. We didn't try dinner as we decided to explore nearby restaurant.  They have a nice garden on 3rd floor, of tower building, which has lot of green and sitting place. However, it is in middle of rooms all around. Also, sanitization at common places was well taken care of ! Overall, it is a old place, with that charm of history and greenery around, but rooms are average. Service is decent and food is good.‚Ä¶"

5,50,"Great service by Abhishek at the reception and equally good service by Ashok and Ravindra Kumar at Dublin bar. They have been absolutely amazing, very polite and very efficient service. I had requested for a TV channel that showed premier league which they didn‚Äôt have but within 1 hour they changed the set of box and get the channel. I have had a great time in this place and I know others will have a better time. I would recommend this place hands down. Come here for great service and amazing hospitality!!"
6,50,"This is a specific review in Covid times regarding the gym management at Windsor, knowing otherwise that ofcourse the overall stay is very comfortable   The gym rules are clearly followed with strict protocols on entry, usage and time.  The equipmentnis sanitized after every use.   They are eco friendly with no plastic and have sanitizers, etc available for guests.   Satish, Srinivas, Thousip, the Spa manager and others are very courteous, helpful and alert in ensuring safety, hygiene and meeting needs of customers.  I confidently recomend it   They are doing their best and more. I wish that guests are also responsible and support them in this endeavor  "
7,50,"I organized a farewell dinner for my office colleagues; we were 20 people. Dushyant the Fn B executive was innovative enough to offer me a dinner by the poolside, an idea that I immediately loved. From.the fantastic royal table set up, the sit down dining experience to the delectable menu ....  it was a fabulous experience from.the word go. Our guests said it was a very memorable experience. Highly recommended!   Sandra Daniels Vice President, Marketing "
8,50,"We stayed at ITC Windsor the last 2 days to attend a residential wedding. The decor, service, food, facilities were fantastic. I loved the culture of the chef coming out into to restaurant and connect with the guests. We had Chef Ruby give us a warm welcome the day we arrived & strike an interesting conversation with us. Chef Venugopal made us feel like family and volunteered to fill our flask with hot filter coffee for our drive back to Chennai. The bell desk folks helped us with filling our water bottles for the journey ahead. Overall it was a home away from home experience for us."
9,50,Its a great place to stay with good rooms and excellent food and to top great hospitality. The breakfast esp. is very nice with a good spread. The other heartening to see is that the hotel has taken enough precautions for Covid.
10,50,"The 5STAR GOES to The co-ordination of BANQUET STAFF because if their extraordinary service and co-operation.   I request the management to treat Banquet Staff in a special manor.   These people made our occasion memorable.   A special thanks to Sathyaraj, Jayaram, Penchalaiah, Shivashakar.   If we will come back that will be because of Banquet STAFF.   Kudos"
11,50,"Was at the Windsor after many years for a childhood friend's engagement. Must say that the hotel has maintained its impeccable standards even through the pandemic and after. Special mention to Mr. Dushyant. He was warm, took time to talk about the property and reminisce about old Bangalore with me. The level of emotional interaction is what makes hotels home and Dushyant is a true professional in the same. Looking forward to more visits"
12,40,"While the property might belong to the iTC Chain, the ‚ÄòWindsor Manor‚Äô - as the property was previously called lovingly by the locals - is a true heritage gem and a historic jewel of the Garden City. A Stay here is more an an Experiential Travel than an Accommodation! And since they come from the old-school hospitality world where fine service means Luxury, be prepared to be pampered by the staff the minute you step into this sanctuary that is nestled in a lovely green enclave. Also , Luxury oozes from all corners and spaces of the hotel and the Room/Suite. Right from the furnishings and wall hanging/posters to the marble tiles and vintage luxury furniture and fittings. You will feel like Royalty staying at this place, especially if you pick one of their fine suites!  LOCATION:‚Ä¶"
13,50,Mum‚Äôs milestone birthday and we wanted a place which would responsibly follow covid protocol while giving us a celebration to remember. I looked no further than Dakshin and the team at ITC Windsor and they delighted us beyond imagination. It was an occasion that was curated thoughtfully and service that went above and beyond to ensure our guests felt safe and comfortable. Thank you team Dakshin and team ITC Windsor for making our day and year! We loved every bit of it.
14,10,"Have ben staying for almost a month. Daily delays in breakfast. have to stand in long queues. On complaining about this issue they do not charge me for dinner and on breakfast table in front of house guests the F&B manager Pratham tells me he gave me free food and bira( a cheap beer during my happy hour). I was staying in towers category btw!!. Oncomplaining about him, ILA from staff told me an action will be taken and I will not see him on the floor. I still saw him everyday!!.Room is not cleaned everyday. Even after requesting staff comes as late as 4 pm to clean. This when hotel is vacant!! Ms. ILA from staff is then asking me to move here and there or sit in the room and get it cleaned by 3 boys. Is this hospitality. Trust me even oyo is better than this. Then they call‚Ä¶"
15,50,"We had New Year brunch today at Raj Pavillion, ITC Windsor. The ambience was way too good with all the strict safety/hygiene protocols in place. We had visited as a family and enjoyed sumptuous food. The hospitality of the staff needs special appreciation and shout out to Chefs Venugopal and Ruby  Islam and all the folks who served food at the table with great care and respect. Can‚Äôt ask for more üëç..Great kick start to the new year by getting indulged with their lip smacking Desserts/pastries  and many more...üëèüòä  Worth the money and great place to chill out especially along the poolside üòä...  Thanks, John and Family!"
16,10,This is very worst people in ITC WINDSOR  no one answer call in service . Lunch order I got after 2.30 hrs after order  Very small place for breakfast no alternate arrangements for breakfast was waiting in queue for 45 min  I have done booking via Bon Voy but my night not got credited in my app  Contacted hotel more than 10 time but no response  Every call make waiting of hrs n hrs  Will never stay as well will advice others not prefer this property  Worst Worst service and staff 
17,10,"Nobody answers to room service. I let the Phone ring d'urine 10 minutes, nobody ans ers. I Phone to r√©ception, ithey say th√© will check Witherspoon th√© kitchenette.. this is just unacceptable in this type of h√¥tel. No excuse, nothing, where is th√© staff ?"
18,40,"All in all, great hospitality, and excellent service by the evergreen Chef S. Venugopal at Raj Pavillion. Good rooms in the towers, although the Manor rooms can do with a bit of renovation. The gardens and the family lounge in the Towers block add a great touch."
19,50,"A very good property for vacation, far away from the busy city crowd. Anywhere one want to go, should have a vehicle or hire cab or auto, and not walking distance.   The hotel decoration is excellent. It seems to be a heritage property, with high ceiling, and beautiful decor.  We only had breakfast in hotels, continental breakfast. The breakfast is standard 4 star one, and not 5 star standard. Dont expect any delicate food items in breakfast.  One lady, helped us a lot - Ms. Ruby Islam. She guided us a lot during our stay in many aspect, specially in breakfast, and some small suggestions and help otherwise. She is very customer friendly.   She helped me to buy a Plum cake. The best plum cake, I ever had anywhere. Anyone visiting the hotel, can request her for a plum cake. Its‚Ä¶"

21,50,"Visiting Bangalore from Toronto with my family. We had a delightful time for the Christmas weekend with the family at ITC Windsor! The hotel was excellent with great service. Special shout out to Chef Venugopal & Chef Ruby at Raj Pavilion. Chef Venugopal went above and beyond in taking care of us. The food & hospitality is excellent! Definitely recommend as a must visit when you visit Bangalore! Old time charm, delightful atmosphere & delicious food."
22,50,"I was head over heel impressed by the excellent hospitality shown to me & my family by Mr Venugopal, especially after a long flight from California. The food recommended & served by Mr S Venugopal was simply amazing! Mr Venugopal was so cheerful and caring - he went out of his way and showed us the banquet hall ..Thanks to him that I‚Äôm planning to have my wedding in Windsor Manor :) I would highly recommend travellers to ask for Mr Venugopal while you visit ITC Windsor Manor for a trusted fun experience."
23,50,"We, a family of four, two adults and two kids (10yrs and 15yrs) checked in on 11th December to 14th December 2020, for 3 nights...   Mr. Suresh at the reception was kind enough to help us with our rooms as soon as he could...   My daughter had specific diet restriction (no/absolutely low copper content in food), and the Chef Mr. Logesh and Exec. Chef Mr. Akshraj Jodha, were very kind enough and thoughtful to help arrange the meals as per her requirements... Not only were they kind enough to heed to our request, but the enthusiasm shown by them to attempt doing something different on meals for my daughter, is highly highly appreciated... Also, special thanks to Chef Venu‚Ä¶   Do note, they are tirelessly working back to back, since they have serious shortage of staff, and I hope‚Ä¶"
24,50,Stayed with my family and we had a lovely stay .The hotel is beautifully designed with all modern amenities and royal touch. The rooms were very comfortable. Executive Chef Mr Jodha and Mr Arin were very warm and took good care of all our requirements. Thanks to GM Mr Manas for being very kind and accommodating our requests. We spent two nights at this beautiful hotel . Looking forward to be back at ITC Windsor and spend more memorable time. Thanks once again to Mr Manas and his excellent team which makes stays long remembered. 
25,50,A wonderful stay at ITC Windsor Bengaluru! I loved the beautiful suite room‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èAnd the food was amazing! I would recommend you to try the dal bukhara which is served at the The Bukhara restaurant! Over all the stay was good and I loved the hospitality. The staff was very friendly and made sure that we were comfortable!  Proper precautions were taken during COVID-19! Rooms were sparkling clean and sanitised!  I have made a reservation for this new year! Looking forward for a wonderful stay once again!  Thank you team ITC you guys are doing a fabulous job!! Thank you for making my stay a memorable one!!
26,50,"My one night stay at ITC Windsor was one of comfort. Extremely welcoming staff. The wide spread breakfast had everything i needed and was very tasty. The breakfast which was customised to our palette and a wonderful interaction with Mr.Venugopal, Chef De Parte, was nice. The room was exquisite and had a very comfortable bed. I can't wait to stay here."
27,30,"My second visit in as much as a month and I instantly regretted choosing this hotel over the other options.   It started as usual with the check in late in the night where in the name of an upgrade you are pushed into the oldest, mustiest room the hotel could have. Cant deny they change it to a lesser tower room on request... I chose not to experiment any further and stick to a room type I had stayed earlier to avoid more surprises.   Tired you call room service for a soup and you get the most amusing answer....Sir only if you would have called 10 minutes earlier, I could have prepared an Asian broth...but... right now we only have....it was nearing midnight so understandable, I guess! I politely declined  A previous visit about a month earlier had breakfast in the room option‚Ä¶"
28,50,"I had gone for a 3 night stay for my husband‚Äôs birthday. It was our first outing after covid struck. I was thoroughly impressed with the room, sanitisation and courtesy of the staff. I highly recommend this property if you want a nice break. The staff went out of their way to make our stay as comfortable as possible. Thank you Neelansh for managin our stay, Dushyant for helping us delicious food from Royal Afghan, Satish from housekeeping and Khushi from front desk for the birthday decoration and towel art!!"
29,50,I visited the place. It's really very beautiful and well maintained. Chef Shobhit had suggested this place to me and I really loved the place :) Highly recommend it to everyone.The food was really very tasty and we thoroughly enjoyed the visit.
30,50,"My experience with ITC hotels has always been the best & they are my first choice when I travel. Given that I am from Bangalore, I barely had a chance to stay at the hotel. This time my newly wed wife & I took time away from home & spent a great time at the hotel. The property is beautifully maintained & in a prime location. The ambience is very welcoming & staff very warm, pleasant to make our stay memorable. I completely trust ITC on two things: 1) responsible luxury - the first hotel chain to adopt to eco-friendly practices & 2) safety & sanitation in times of the pandemic. Great view & excellent F&B outlets. A great stress buster from the hustle & bustle of the city although located in the heart of the city. One can never imagine the calm environment amidst the place where‚Ä¶"
31,50,"The property needs no introduction as it's always one of the best among all ITC hotels. At this pandemic situation they have maintained and followed all hygienic and safety measures. Really thankful to Mrs. Ila and team for the wonderful service provided. The stay was really comfortable. Thanks ""ITC Windsor"" for such an awesome experience."
32,50,"We had initially planned for just a day's stay at the Windsor hotel, but a few hours at the property and we felt safe enough to extend our stay considering how well they followed their hygiene standards. The staff was extremely warm and welcoming and helped with anything and everything we required. There were a few hiccups along the stay, but there were quick resolutions. Would definitely like to point out the efforts that all the chefs and staff at the restaurants took to ensure that we had our special food requests met! Awesome job!  Special thanks to all the front desk staff for their quick issue resolution! All in all a great stay!"
33,40,"The food was nice and the buttermilk cheesecake was very delicious , a must try. Chef Venugopal was a pleasant man who tended to our every need with regards to the food. A very comfortable visit for us."
34,50,"Had a very safe dining experience, every thing is sanitized and service by Dayanand was very prompt! Will surely come back again soon with my family as I got the assurance that it‚Äôs very safe and well maintained"
35,50,Chris and Ashok have always made me feel home away from home and their customer service is been authentic and outstanding.. They have been an amazing host and my relationship with Dublin has been from 17 year's.. I really appreciate and thank you with all my heart to your service ..

38,50,I'm glad I decided not to miss my best friend's wedding because of the pandemic as ITC put all my safety fears at bay.  I'm very pleased by the way the staff has adapted to this new normal and how their strictness for safety and hygiene reflects in everything around. Special thanks to Ila Prabhu for being kind enough to personally help me out with dispatching one of the belongings I had accidentally left at the hotel.
39,50,"A late post but then few memories are such that they don‚Äôt leave you so soon and one such was our staycation cum birthday celebration at @itcwindsor .Freaking out to go somewhere due to Covid forget it completely ITC Windsor had taken every step to ensure safety right from placing sanitsers at every nook and corner , wooden sticks in lifts to operate them , safety partitions in Raj Pavillion , cleaning and sanitization of the premises etc the whole hygiene protocols were elevated. We stayed in the suite room and the perks was an entry to Lancelot Garden and the most amazing part was the Suite it was so elegant and was a blend of modern and vintage look. Loved every part of my stay right from ease of booking and check special thanks to Mr.Dushyant for this , birthday surprise‚Ä¶"
40,30,I had traveled back from London on the VBM flight and landed in Bangalore on 11th July. After all the lengthy formalities at the airport reached the hotel around 8pm. Unfortunately the rooms were not ready and we had to wait till almost 10pm when finally got a room. The checkin experience was very bad and not at all expected from a 5* hotel üôÅ. Next day the hotel manager informed us that they were only told about 15-20 people coming in but close to 90 had turned up and they were short of staff to accommodate suddenly. After the initial checkin experience the stay was good though.
41,50,"ITC Windsor .... My all time favourite... Best service with bestest staff... Specifically Mr.Prem, Mr. Murthy from royal Afghan, Mr.Murthy from Raj pavilion..they are really great. . I would love to come back soon."

43,50,It was really a short stay but it's really worthy for each penny I got complimentary upgrade to the tower room which had a beautiful view of the Lancet garden ware as the checking process was smooth and quick and the staffs were really helpful and very friendly  the breakfast it was was not a buffet because of the covid was fix admin but the menu was quite good  and the staff were there was also very helpful attentive and quick in service and even gave me  access to the gym cause of pandemic  protocol in which they allowed only one person at a time after the workout they they were sanitizing the whole gym which I found really Great where which shows the management they are really concerned about  safety of the guest hope to stay soon next time
44,50,"Had a remarkable weekend at ITC Windsor. Excellent hotel ,extremely clean & comfortable. We were warmly welcomed by the reception staff Khushi and she made our stay more interesting with complementary upgrade and a delicious cake. Would love to visit again and recommend to others.  Last but not the least is the excellent dinning experience. It was beyond our expectation and added extra star to our stay."
45,50,"I stayed at the hotel for a two night break. The food i had was lovely. The room was nice with a lovely walk in shower in the bathroom with lots of hot water. Dinesh, the bell captain was very helpful in getting a very old bag i had mended so i hope i can continue to use it for many more years. I am very grateful to him for his service. Looking forward to coming back next week."

47,50,"There are some hotels that meet your expectations and then a few rare ones that you can't stop raving about.   What I observed from the very onset of arriving at the hotel is that every little thing here is done with perfection. The rooms are stunning (my photos don't do enough justice) with vintage furniture, wooden floors, and the perfect writing desks.   I was particularly impressed by the staff members' warm hospitality and standards of perfection. The housekeeping team who did a flawless job each morning, the duty manager who provided the garden view room at my last minute request, the bell boy/ concierge who courteously handed me the things I'd left behind in the room by mistake, and so many more that I forget. A big thank you to the entire team for a perfect stay."
48,50,"We stayed at ITC Windsor for a night. The safety and hygiene levels are top notch. We were scared getting to the hotel, but once we got off the car, the fear factor was gone in 2 minutes. We instantly knew that we were safe and the management will leave no stones unturned for our safety.  Neelansh at front desk was phenomenal and explained us about all the things the hotel was doing to keep the guests safe.  Room was spacious and comfortable and food was yummy (as expected)"

Keep up the good work team"
55,50,"With the whole city still shut and lockdown barely having been lifted, work-cations and stay-cations have become the norm during COVID-19 world over. We decided to give this a shot with ITC Windsor. Given the amount of time we used to spend at Dublin, their bar during normal times, it made sense to use the points and stay at one of their palatial rooms for the weekend. Right from the go, the team were extremely helpful, Neelansh in particular, speaking to us and clarifying all our doubts much before we even got there. He had assured us that the entire pick up, check in, food service and checkout process would be contactless and safe and it most definitely was. At no point did we feel worried that someone was close to us nor were there any contact points throughout our stay.  ‚Ä¶"

Needless to say that my Aunt thoroughly enjoyed the food and couldn‚Äôt wait to share her experience immediately.   The snack bag menu specially curated truly was a good blend of snacks(both taste wise and quantity). It was equally good value for money spent.

58,50,"I came  ITC Windsor a week ago, I must appreciate the young staff working there with all the safety wearables in this COVID situation. Service was very smooth and I felt the cleanliness all around and care, they offered me hand gloves and sanitising wherever required. I really loved the food it was so soft and fresh and also delivered the food instructions, the way I required."
59,50,"I was on my one day business tour to Bangalore where I went to ITC Windsor for dining at Raj Pavilion, which was the very nice experience specially in the tough pandemic situation, the hotel has followed all the guidelines and made the hygienic environment with proper safety gears wore by staff and the sitting arrangement with fibre sheet separators. In short, I felt safe there! It was amazing."
60,50,"The hotel was not very full, probably because the world wide coronavirus epidemic was beginning to have an effect. Consequently we were upgraded to a top floor room with stunning views out over the city. Many of the staff were young, often in their first job, with energy levels and enthusiasm to match. Not being rushed off their feet they often had time to chat which made our stay a much more personal experience than you might expect from a business hotel. All were good with excellent services, although the room was not very spacious but the spectacular view from the room was worth it. Rahul Sharma from the desk was very cheerful and professional I was very much satisfied with the se each and everything was taken care of.  Check in to check out all in one was perfect even after‚Ä¶"

62,50,"Heritage property situated in the heart of the city. We went for one day's staycation and had a great and relaxing time here. Ms. Sharanya from the hotel team had arranged a beautiful surprise for us and she was very cordial and polite.   We also explored all the restaurants in the hotel and enjoyed each one of them immensely. Dum Pukht was amazing with its delicious biryani and naan, and even better was Dublin, which provided us one of our finest pub experiences in Bangalore. Mr. Kundan was a great host and the decor of the pub was really nice.   They even gave an amazing almond cake complimentary at the end of our visit, which was a wonderful gesture from them (Ms Sharanya, again) - we enjoyed it for days, remembering our stay at the hotel.

Thanks for making my stay great.
65,40,A luxury hotel in the heart of Bangalore. Although the rooms are somewhat small we could still easily sleep there with the three of us (me and my two teenage sons). The staff was really friendly and the hotel has a number of fine restaurants.  From there you can easily use Uber to get anywhere in Bangalore.
66,50,"We had a very pleasant and memorable stay at the Windsor Suite.  We thank Mumtaz, Shefali  and Sunil Kumar for their excellent service. The food is very  delicious  both at the Dum Pukht and  at The Raj Pavilion. The whole team is very friendly and helpful."

For someone like me it was a pleasure to visit every part of the property since I loved the historical aspect of it.

I could not find switch off for 15 mins.¬† Called reception, they sent a office boy - he could also not find the switch !!!¬† Then he went for electrician - by that time I found it myself. 2.¬† The bathroom was very congested, if I am taking a shower - I could not even turn around properly - I would expect better from a 5 star !  3.¬† The food was a let down. I ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, which was bland.¬† The breakfast was all regular stuff, nothing exotic. Again the flavor of food in breakfast was toned down, I get better tasting Indian food in US chain 4 * hotel.¬† It seems you are toning food taste down for foreigners?  4. When checking out at 4 AM, I was offered packed‚Ä¶"
72,50,"I visited Pavilion Restaurant for high tea with family.  They served very nice, tasty and lovely snacks.  We had authentic Ceylon Green Tea.  A serene and quiet place to sit and enjoy the snacks.  The Pavilion is day lit and as the shadows lengthen they open the roof for day light.  It is a real transformation in the ambience.

75,40,"Not much of a review writer and being an Indian am used to the hospitality that we offer anyway and also have been blessed to get good warm treatment in good Hotels across the country. But this time around had a happy feeling by being in ITC Windsor and actually felt like I should stay longer. Small things mattered be it Chef Dhiren genuinely making an effort to dial a conversation with a reserved one like me or Asif being extra careful on my drink at that Irish pub late in the night. Since am somebody who notice small details, I couldn't not see the small water leak in the washroom or the little bit of delay that usual on the delivery of dental kit but those r really very small issues and the key is the staff is just genuinely proud of their hotel and tries to infect you with‚Ä¶"
76,50,"Not having been to Bengaluru before, we didn't know what to expect. It is a bustling city, said to be the pub capital of India, but it is not a destination for tourists. The ITC Windsor Hotel saved our four-day visit from being a total disappointment, however. We had pre-paid our room and, on check-in, were informed we had been upgraded to a better room with garden access, were given access to the private lounge with two hours of complimentary drink and food each evening, and a 15% discount on other food and drink. The room was spacious and spotless, the staff excellent and the two-hour daily ""happy hour"" in the private lounge the cherry on the cake. The only slight criticism is that we asked how much it would be for the hotel car to take us to the market district and were‚Ä¶"

128,10,"I wrote the following response direct to management a week ago with no response:  I traveled to India last month and stayed in the ITC hotels in Hyderabad (Kohenur) and Bangalore (Winsor).   The stay at Kohenur was exceptional as always and the team there went out of their way to make my stay pleasant and sorted out a challenging luggage issue for me.  Unfortunately, my stay this time at Winsor was a disaster. My first impressions and great experiences of India comes from staying at ITC hotels over the last few years (Mumbai, Jaipur, Delhi, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, etc.). I requested that my Indian partners book me at the Winsor. Firstly the room I was allocated was dirty, run down and the toilet was not working.

143,10,Went for a get together at royal Afghan restaurant. We heard a lot about the restaurant but didn't find the same. They couldn't meet upto our expectations. They have good staff but sometimes we felt they were bit lost. May be because the restaurant was very busy. Food taste was average and the prices were too high. I personally do not recommend this restaurant.....there are many restaurants nearby better than this. This is extensively super expensive with average taste food. Peshawari naan wasn't the same as we have seen in pictures.....
144,50,A special hotel. A very warm and welcome feeling. The staff was exceptional. Very polite and prompt. The breakfast was a very good spread and of good quality.

397,10,Itc Windsor was one of the finest hotel to visit.  But I m very dissapointed with the service this time.  It is deteriorating badly for which the management should do something . I was there in the restaurant for dinner and almost spend 2 hours but could not find any manager coming and acknowledging . Stewards are trying  hard to meet the needs of a table but they are not educated enough to speak English and communicate properly . When we pay 1500 for a simple salad and coffee then it is obvious that we are paying not just for the food but also for the standard service.  I hope next time I am not dissapointed like this
