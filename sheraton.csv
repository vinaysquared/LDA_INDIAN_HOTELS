Fortunately the hotel management was quick to pacify me and saw reason in my anger. I decided to give their Sunday brunch another chance and boy they redeemed themselves. Truly what a lazy Sunday brunch should be, we friends had a ball of a time, had a lazy lunch with some amazing food and cocktails, chatted for hours and all throughout the time we were looked after all our needs which made it completely worth the time. I am glad I came back and there is this quality about the brand Marriott which is inspiring and keeps its most loyal consumers coming back to it. Thanks Neeraj and your entire…"

In terms of rooms and amenities I would  not say this the best 5 star experience I ever had but what made our stay special are the people and their tremendous effort to make us comfortable. The staff were really nice, friendly and accommodative. We  had a quarantine stay with a small baby and thus we were initially bit worried about the experience, specially during such pandemic time. However the hotel management accepted all our special requests including a suit upgrade, a small cooking facility in side the room, doctor on call, optimised food options for my baby, allowing Amazon delivery etc. These small things all together was a relief for us.

272,50,I did a Agile planning event for our Org during January last week in Sheraton Bangalore for 5 days. Awesome service and response from the Team. The hospitality team was excellent and food was great (Had lot of options).
273,50,"It’s late but I am taking this lockdown opportunity to write about my good  experience I had with my wife when we visited Sheraton Whitefield to celebrate our Anniversary.. I must say, it was indeed a great night. Love the decor and what an amazing food we had. The staff was very attentive and we were surprised that they had arranged a cake for us. The situation right now is tough but I hope it comes back to normal again soon to enjoy such lavish experience."
274,50,"We ordered food from Sheraton 2 days back after a lot of thought and finally realising that if we want to order and make sure hygiene is followed then our best bet was Sheraton which is in prestige Shantiniketan.   We ordered some Chinese and when it got delivered we realised that the prices were quite subsidised and the packaging was very neat. The delivery was prompt too. The taste was outstanding as always and the quantity was satisfying to the belly.   We were so happy with the overall experience that we ordered Some Indian food for dinner the same day, and I must say, the Dal makhani was nothing that we have ever tried before. The food was outstanding.   We want to thank Sheraton for the amazing service and good they are providing even during the whole lockdown period."
275,50,"During these times, their home delivery service was top notch. Both from quality & packaging perspective. Pankaj who delivers the food was very courteous and helpful. It was really interesting that they were providing other helpful services too (i.e Laundry etc)."
276,50,"I ordered thai red curry veg and non veg, burnt garlic fried rice and jasmine rice  from Sheraton and it was really a 10/10 from packaging to the ingredients used in each and every item. Amazing Service!"
277,50,"Given the current covid we were unable to step out but at the same time wanted to do something in our anniversary. Planned a surprise dinner at home for this. Ordered from Sheraton. Excellent food and maintaining health,  hygiene and safety. Keep it up team ! Thanks a lot !"
278,30,"I was here for a Conference, Good thing is one doesn't have to set a foot outside because of a large nice convention Centre attached to the property. But beyond that everything was just average. i didn't have that feeling of 5 Star luxury in my stay    "
279,40,We were coming to eat in one of the restaurant last Saturday 14th March  The staffs on the gate with white shirt were asking where we want to go we said we came to have lunch. They told us that it is close.  So we try to went back in which we knew it's not close at all and as we were very hungry and again we went back and after all they discuss something  they let us in and dine in Feast.  The service and staff were polite and great in the restaurant  Tho it's not a very good experience about entering the hotel!
280,50,"Warm, welcoming and proactive people in an amazing property. Need to specially mention Phurpha Lhamo, who made our time & stay a memorable one.  Will recommend this property for both business as well personal stay."

282,50,"There are certain moments in which you felt time stood still, my stay at Sheraton Grand was such. I was here to celebrate my girlfriend’s birthday. I made a call to check if the team at the hotel could make arrangements. Phurpa, from the team immediately reached out shared her suggestions, made arrangements, set me up in a suite, decorated the room with balloons, flowers, etc (more than I could think of). Making this one of the best birthdays we’ve (my girlfriend) and I have spent till date. Huge thanks to Jayanta, Tanmay and Isha for ensuring the stay was smooth and checkout was smoother.   Shout to Ruchika, to check in on me post my stay to see if everything went ok. Highly recommend this place if you want to have a staycation, or do a lot without the commuting (to the mall,…"
283,50,"This hotel had the buzz even before it officially opened in Whitefield. Ive stayed at this property 4 times till date and haven't been disappointed not even once.  The moment you walk-in, you can feel the luxury vibe and the excellent service you can expect. From Check-In to the room till the Check Out, utmost care is taken by every individual staff you encounter during your stay.   Being a Titanium Elite member, they left no stone unturned every single time i stayed there. Be it the gorgeous and spacious Suite Upgrades to the amazing Lounge Access to the small details like the desserts and wine in the room. The beds feel so comfortable and soothing, everyone is bound to get an amazing sleep after a tiring day.   The Club Lounge is something that needs special mention at this…"

298,40,"Very decent all round business hotel convenient for businesses on the east of the city.   Check in was smooth. Rooms very good with nice bathrooms. WiFi in rooms is decent. Breakfast everything you’d expect and a good gym with modern equipment. Dinner at InAzia exceeded expectations - the chef came out to greet us and was very friendly.   Three minor wrinkles to note.   First, and one of my bugbears, a complicated lighting system in rooms with lots of trial and error needed to get the right lights on or all the lights off!  Second, the lifts were pretty slow - a couple seemed to be out of action.   Finally, trying to track down bar staff to serve at the pool bar was painful.   Transport to/from airport was seamless, notwithstanding the usual mayhem of Bangalore traffic! …"
299,50,Must say one of the best places to stay in Bangalore which has only raised the benchmark in service. Special mention of Shambhavi and Ruchika who make you feel so at home in the lounge.  The anniversary cake cutting was the icing on the cake.
300,50,I was at this property for 2 nights to attend a business conference. The room I very spacious and all amenities are provided. Staff is very courteous and warm.  Food was the highlight. The spread in all the meals was more than I had expected.  A well deserved 5 star rating!

On behalf of my whole team, I take this opportunity to thank you guys for helping us have a wonderful time there with a good ambience and amazing tasty and clean food. I am very happy to express my appreciation to the hotel staff who were very well-mannered, respectful, kind.

313,50,"I stayed a total of 15 nights at the Sheraton Grand Bengaluru and had a truly enjoyable stay at this hotel.   Initially I had some issues with my scheduled transport from the hotel forgetting about me, some flies in my room, shower leak and some unclean cutlery however after sharing the feedback with the hotel, they were quick to react and provide me with alternative solutions.   Special thanks to Ajay who helped to sort out the transportation issue   And also to Ms Phurpa who took special care and attention to help me resolve the issues with regards to my room & took the time to check-in on me daily to make sure the rest of my stay went by smoothly.

319,40,Stayed for 3 days. I liked the hotel. The room was great. Comfortable bed. Clean linen. Sufficient amount of toiletries in the bathroom. Sufficient cupboard storage.  Room cleaning service good. A lot of options for breakfast. Very friendly staff. Overall 4 stars for the stay. Just one star is less for - 1- They had kept filter coffee sachets in the room but no filter or brewer 2- The over the head shower (rain types) it was non-functional and I had to struggle hard with its switch to hold it and make it work. This is such a good brand and I guess these small-small things should have been taken care of. Thanks for reading the review.

322,50,"My daughter and I spent a week in the Sheraton Grand Bedngaluru Whitefield Hotel recently. We had a wonderful week - all aspects of our stay exceeded our expectation,  We had a suite on the second floor - a most comfortable bedroom and a separate sitting room with a galley-type kitchenette and a well equipped bathroom. The breakfasts were stunning - with Asian, European and U.S. cuisine, artistically presented in buffet-style. As Club members, we availed most evenings of drinks and canapes in the sixth floor members' lounge - here again the choice of finger food was outstanding.  But what really stood out for me was the exceptionally helpful and friendly staff, who went way beyond the call of duty to make us feel welcome. I would like to mention in particular the friendliness…"

347,10,I have been to the restaurant at Sheraton with my couple of friends twice. Once for the breakfast and once for the dinner. Both the time i have given my bonvoy number to the restaurant executive/manager not sure but he was wearing business suite. I had called the hotel many times for asking them to credit the dining points. Either will say we will get it done or sometimes their manager is too busy to come on call to talk or to call back. Very disappointed with the kind of follow up from their manager. I understand that receiving points takes at least 1 week but not more than a month. I have dinned once on 25th Dec 2019 and till date have neither received the points nor received the call back. ..
348,10,excepted a lot of things but not so good experience..  food taste was okay  a lot to improve  hooping to have a good time again in next time  be focused on services n food quality  too expensive  beyond the budget
349,50,Food and service is good .excellent service provide by nandan .his attitude is friendly  .I enjoyed the food .I happy with Sheraton grand whitefield hotel and convention centre .so nice behaved all staff.
350,40,"The Sheraton in Whitefield has all the hallmarks you’d expect of a Sheraton/Marriott hotel - well appointed bedrooms, immaculately clean throughout, courteous staff and impressive facilities.  The buffet breakfast offers practically anything you could possibly want to eat in the morning, with several things made to order (omelettes, pancakes, etc).  The service in the bar was a bit erratic - despite ample staff, it often took a while to get a drink. The price of drinks was a bit baffling too, with some foreign beers costing 2-3 times as much as others, when there would normally be little variation. The food served at the bar was very tasty though, especially the shashlik."
351,50,I had a great experience in Sheraton grand hotel and convention centre hotel service was excellent and food also delicious speacial thank to mr laxman Mr govind.subham and Mr Rajesh they are very helpful.all team make the event succesful.and I will surely visit again

It is ideally located near major corporations and IT parks in the fastest growing suburb of Bangalore called Whitefield. Sheraton Whitefield is part of the Marriott group of hotels. We stayed in the Junior Kitchenette suite room of Sheraton Whitefield which offers a spacious bathroom, separate living area and comfortable king bed with complimentary Sheraton Club Lounge access. We had a fully equipped kitchenette with a microwave, induction cooktop and all cutlery. This is specially good for people who can plan for a longer stay while shifting between 2 cities.

Breakfast was a treat. The breakfast staff laid out the red carpet, the kids took full advantage of it.   Overall a really great stay.

447,50,"Visited to surprise my wife on her birthday. I had reached out to the hotel over email with specific requests - Phurpa & her Team was very proactive in responding and arranging for a cake, balloons and desserts etc. The best aspect was that instead of back and forth over email or call, Phurpa connected with me through WhatsApp before check-in and during the stay. I did not even need to show up at the counter when I was checking in. Phurpa and her team recognized me the moment i was entering the lobby, took us to the room which was already ready - and kept the paper work digital and non-intrusive.

478,50,"During my first visit hotel, I must confess that I was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the hotel. The staff is customer-oriented and will make sure your needs are provided for.   The drive from the airport is very long (one hour and a half on a Sunday). Avoid surprises by finding out how much it cost if the hotel is providing the service  Check-in was smooth.  A staff member by the name of Ishvi helped me out. In my room, I found a complimentary bottle of wine and pieces of delicious chocolate, which I enjoyed. I had breakfast at the Feast in the morning. They have plenty of items: Cereals, omelets, Indian breakfasts, etc…  Several times, I had the pleasure to request information at the front desk. Sapna, the staff member, diligently took notes of my questions and…"

The housekeeping staff would make sure your room is clean and dust-free.

492,50,"I stayed at Sheraton for a 3 day company event.  Everything about the place is awesome. The Rooms, Food, Staff and Service.   But what made my stay particularly memorable was the gesture by Purpah Lhmao. It was my 10 year wedding anniversary and I had to be in Bangalore. My husband reached out to Purpah and requested for a cake to be delivered to me at 12am. Purpah was excited and requested my husband to send her our pics. And what she did was unbelievable. She made a card with our pics in it. Wrote some beautiful wordings (handwritten not typed) and had it sent with the cake. The title of the card was ""The best thing to hold onto life is each other"". Moreover on the card there was no mention of Sheraton!!!  How many times do people go beyond their duty and beyond what is…"

Ashish, Sam, Aashish, phurpa"
496,50,"At the outset, let me start off by saying this is hospitality and customer experience at its very best. Starting with the front office led by Ishvi Tandon and Shambhavi Pawar the attention to detail at this property is first class. As a Bonvoy Platinum, the pre-checkin welcome, the upgrade to a suite, the personal cards left in the room welcoming you to the property along with a nice bottle of wine and some confections were truly appreciated. This team needs to be given a lifelong contract at the Sheraton. I personally would not stay any place else during my Bangalore visits and this coming from a traveller who has stayed at almost every other property in Bangalore. The definition of luxury can be found here. Thank you sheraton whitefield for your excellent service, immaculate…"
497,50,"I checked-in at 5 am this morning, and asked for my shirts to be ironed.  Not a problem whatsoever !   Prompt, courteous and efficient service.  Thank you AMITEJ for your super customer centric approach to helping me."

Special thank to atashi and the hosties sonia ( name tag). "
502,50,"We are very regular diners at The Sheraton ever since it opened! Were there every couple of weeks, in fact! Not because it’s close to our home- but because the Feast is brilliant!  The food is amazing, the desserts and ambience are splendid and the service exemplary. You shouldn’t miss the Sunday brunches as they really put in immense effort to set things up then- the champagne overflows, the desserts are always themed and the staff go out of their way to make you, your family, your friends and your guests really have an enjoyable time! Look out for Illivi and Sudarshana, especially! Wonderful hosts. 👌👍👏🍷👌 "
503,40,"Was at Sheraton for 7 days and I’m in awe of their hospitality. Special mentions to Ishvi, the guest relations manager who ensured my stay was smooth. I’m delighted by her service as she took care of me in person. Definitely going back to experience her hospitality again."

When i have breakfast, they came frequently to check if i was ok or need anything. Food was really good. Room is tidy and clean. I really love the smell of their liquid soap and handbody thus i secure them daily haha. When i order in room dining, they came really fast. Laundy was on time and clean. I ask direction to prestige office but they accompany me with golf car 👍🏻. I got love card from hotel staff with cute souvenir doll (Thank you Tenzin 😊). Driver staff (S. Hussein) also nice and friendly. Feels like 2nd home💝"
505,50,"We have selected the convention center for our Annual party which was a great success. All are extremely happy with the ambiance, arrangements, food, cleanliness, safety & Security, Parking etc.  Food was excellent!! Appam Live counter was a super hit!!  There is a lot of good things to share about Sheraton Grand Whitefield.  This is the 2nd consecutive year we are using their Convention Center for our annual party, which was a memorable one. Starting from Sales, event planning, customizing the menu … everything was so smooth. Sales & Banquet staff are very courteous and amazing (Amit Rana, Nitin Maria, Piyali, Manish, Avinash & Yash to name a few). Very good ambiance, great hospitality, awesome food.

510,50,"The hotel lived up to all expectations when it comes to a Sheraton Hotel.  The facilities were spacious and adequate for all from the breakfast buffet and bars/restaurants around the premises to the gym and pool.  The rooms are well maintained and feel like new.  Most importantly though, staff wanted to have a conversation and really look after you during the stay.  I was sitting down to breakfast one morning and got chatting with the Head Chef.  The next night he and the team have put together a feast off the menu sampling a range of curries and local treats.  They were proud to showcase Sheraton, Bangalore and India."
511,50,"I had a very comfortable and pleasant stay. I have stayed at the Rajajinagar Sheraton many times and I am very pleased they opened one in Whitefield.  In an email to Guest Relations before my stay, I asked for a 5"" firm pillow and I was pleasantly surprised to find the same type of pillow that I use at home. I enjoyed dining at the Feast every night. I want to call out Mr Jayanta, Ms Pallavi and Ms Prerna for their amazing service at the Feast. They made sure I had everything I needed during breakfast and dinner and went above and beyond to make me comfortable. The room service too was exemplary although I don’t know the names of the people who cleaned my room every day; they did a top notch job cleaning the room and leaving it impeccable.  If you are staying in the Whitefield…"
512,40,"We have gone there to attend one marrige function. The Hotel is very beautiful and impressive. The layout, decor, lobby ... every thing is good. We can say beautifull. Even rest rooms are very nice. We definetly suggest this hotel if budget is not a problem."
513,50,One of the best hotels in the city.  Impressive staff and hospitality. Will love to come back again and again to this property.the team was so helpful and the food was excellent. The best 5star hotel in the city
514,50,"I stayed at the hotel for about one month. I am a lifetime platinum Bonvoy member but I can tell you my treatment by the staff at this hotel was not based on my “status”. I witnessed their same treatment of all others as well! It was truly incredible every single staff person was super nice and extremely concerned to ensure I was always 100% satisfied with the service, the food and my room!   I cannot name all of the employees who helped me so much but here are a few who went above the call of duty to make sure I had a wonderful stay:  Prithesh - This gentleman was my personal pancake cook each morning for breakfast! 6 delicious pancakes with whipped butter, chocolate chips, maple syrup and whipped cream. Waking up early and getting ready for the day was never difficult knowing…"
515,50,Excellent hotel close in the White-field area. Rooms are spacious with a modern design. From the bathroom you can see the room and watch tv if you like. Opposite hotel is shopping mall. The pool is also very nice and all surroundings are spotlessly clean. The staff is friendly and professional as always and all speaks very good English. The best of all is the breakfast which is amazing and the food just delicious. I would definitely recommend for business travelers. For vacation travel is a bit too far from the center and the traffic is horrible. 
516,50,"Selected the restaurant based on reviews, and should say was not at all disappointed. The ambiance is good. The variety and taste of the vegetarian selection is good in the buffet.  Excellent service by Mr. Pankaj. I would recommend this restaurant far a nice and calm evening with family or friends."
517,50,"I always look forward to my stay when I travel to Bangalore, as this is the only place I prefer to stay. Every staff member go above and beyond to take care of guests.  Help desk staff greet you warmly and make sure your stay is comfortable.  Make sure you try every restaurant at this place. Every one has a unique taste and experience. (thumbs up)"
518,50,"I have been travelling to Bangalore for many years on business.  Usually I stay in central Bangalore either at the ITC Gardenia or Ritz Carlton.  When in Whitefield I usually stay at the Marriott.  This was my first stay at the Sheraton, and I would rate it ahead of the Marriott and ITC, and only slightly behind the Ritz.  The service is excellent.  Rooms were very clean.  I hosted three client dinners at the Asian restaurant as well as the Indian buffet (Feast) - both were excellent.  Breakfast was also amazing.  Only slight complaint is that the air con was hard to control in the room, but this isn’t unusual for India.  The location is also ideal if you are working at the Prestige business park, as everything is walkable.  Anything that avoids driving in Bangalore is good.  I…"
519,50,"If you've got a sweet tooth and love exploring new places then Feast at Sheraton Grand is the best! Their Food is just out of the world. I don't remember the last time I tasted something so PERFECT! The texture is made so well that it just melts in your mouth whether it is dessert, starter or main course. We have been visiting Feast quite regularly just because of perfect quality buffet spread.  Please do try it out. Full marks for food, ambiance and service!! I loved the food variety, quality and taste. Overall it is very good experience and value for money. Food lovers must try at least once…Staff is very friendly and helpful."
520,50,Always enjoyed the buffet dinner. Thursday sea food carnival is good. Biswajit the bar tender is very friendly too. Try their cocktails. It’s a paradise for those who love their dessert. The Chefs are very courteous. Sometimes they have nice chaat stalls too.

I enjoyed the live singing as well.Bar tender have got a special drink for me.I will definitely  come back."
526,50,"The rooms are large enough . Comfortable beds and clean . The checkin was smooth . The layout of hotel is little confusing , but it’s fine . The swimming pool was clean . The food was really good especially the breakfast "

532,40,"Generally you don't need to write a review for a hotel like Sheraton and it's one of my preferred hotels for stay abroad. This time we went for a Lunch Buffet - All was good, but.. The restaurant ""Feast"" had almost everything included in the Buffet but i was looking for a pork dish too. Couldn't find any servings of pork. A restaurant of this stature should have this minimum serving."
533,50,"Overall very good food and service. Really appreciate the service especially. Pankaj, a service executive was really polite and helpful as were every other people around here. The overall varieties of food can be improved/increased, especially in the starter section. But a nice place overall"

535,50,"I would like to thank each individual in your team who really make difference by their hospitality provided to their guests. I have been there for Sunday Brunch on 27th Oct. The hotel lobby was really welcoming with beautifully Rangoli and flower arrangement at the centre. Restaurants corridore and entire public are was sparkling and reflecting the joy of Diwali. I dnt remember the name of the restaurant where I had the food however the buffet set up and live counters were amazingly displayed with its specialty and charm. People around service personals were so professional in approach and very very polite and helpful. Your pool view seating was amazing, despite of having a crowd and festive weekend the cleaning and aura were maintained on a top notch.  Loved the service offered…"
536,40,Most Buffets are the kind which Less Said the better. Sometimes a large spread without appeal scores worse than a small spread with special some things... The Feast is much smaller to its counterpart in Brigade Gateway. It seats overlooking the Pool in the center and the seats are comfortable and Table setting is clean and neutral and the table spacing is acceptable inspite of it being a smaller restaurant.  If you called ahead the Restaurant In charge really makes an effort to please and impress and lives up to the standards of hospitality which makes food appealing.  We came here for an evening with a family and friends... Alas The friend could not make it as the approach to it from all sides is beyond really daunting traffic from all sides. Well I was here and enjoyed the…
537,50,"Today's lunch at InAzia was a unique experience indeed.The Chinese which they served was quite authentic with its mild and fresh look, aroma and taste. The quality of the ingredients was truly impressive. To top it all the Chef Rungtiwa was sweet enough to interact personally enlightening us with the kind of information which is enriching for the inquisitive mind. Thank you for the intimate hospitality of the chef and her crew."
538,50,"Wow your buffet is excellent....  Have a great time there, buffet spread is huge. Enjoyed a lot, all the staff and chefs are very caring. They have made our day. Special thanks to Abhishek Kumar. Planning to visit again very soon .. :)"

546,50,"We hosted the  E-day ( Engineering Day) at the Sheraton Grand and it was a Grand Success. Sheraton is the only star hotel which has a full fledged convention center with all amenities & facilities which could cater to our requirements. It was a two day event and everything went like a clockwork and we concluded the event without any glitch.  This couldn't have been possible without the relentless support of teams like Sales,F&B ,Room service,Security deployed for the event were just outstanding. Everyone demonstrated through professionalism and every single person understood our requirements and the same time they were very hospitable.   We sincerely Thank the entire team for this great experience!"

I feel so blessed to have the opportunity to experience such an amazing city and culture.  This is the best hotel experience I’ve had in all my travels. The Housekeeping Team ( Oliva and Nikita) really made me feel like home! They gifted me with so many precious animals. I looked forward to the surprises they would leave me when returning from long work days. My heart was happy! Please give them something special.   Prerna is OUTSTANDING! She greeted me faithfully every morning. She truly exemplified excellent  hospitality. I looked forward to our morning discussions. I will miss her.  Chef Mohammad…

The club lounge was brilliant and very well run.  The manager and the chef were both extremely friendly and helpful in every way possible.  The breakfast and happy hour offerings were beyond belief with so many fun and interesting choices.  The space was also quite big.  The hotel restaurant too was very good and offered a tasting menu of Southern Indian food, very lovely.  The conference space downstairs was also top notch.  Was so sad to leave the hotel being my home away from home while on business in the area.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone needing to be in the area."
553,50,"The staff provide a very friendly experience and offer to introduce you to local cuisines and dishes that most people might not know about. As someone who was visiting India for the first time, I got to learn about and enjoy a number of tasty dishes and beverages that I might not have had it not been for the fine people at Feast. "

Right from the start we got excellent service, starting with the front desk right through to house keeping , restaurant etc.  Our first encounter with the Purnima from housekeeping was memorable, As we arrived early we were given access to the room while housekeeping was still in progress. When we came back up a bit later we saw for the first time her ""Towel Art"" from then on she did more and more elaborate displays and even decided to teach my wife how to do it. She was very enthusiastic and bubbly and really keen to make our stay pleasant.    Breakfast and restaurant staff was equally service minded all the way from Head chef JP SIngh to all the staff that served us (e.g. Amit ),   You really…"
556,50,"I stayed here for 2 nights. I arrived hotel like 1.15AM, check-in was super fast , like within 3 minutes! It's super convenient as I could just walk to my office. Really big pool, u can do laps. Not far from Phonix MarketCity mall/VR Bengaluru (where you can take photo with I Love BLR sign), like 15-20 mins uber ride. The bar downstairs is nice too, good vibe :) Breakfast was good."
557,50,"Amazing Hotel with great and professional staff , all is perfectly organized, clean and everybody is happy there ! Fantastic  experience and the food is GREAT ! Thank you William , Nitin and all the Chefs at Feist snd Asia Restaurants !"
558,50,My week at the Sheraton Grand Bengaluru Whitefield Hotel & Convention Center was fantastic at usual like all the other Marriott properties. What I loved is that we are taken care of to the point that we don't miss our homes. Thank you for the wonderful stay.
559,50,"The staff members throughout my stay were very professional, friendly and extremely helpful. The breakfast were amazing, a wonderful selection, and again, the staff were very efficient and helpful in making the breakfast times fun and enjoyable. I also appreciate your chefs taking a walk around the tables and reviewing with guests for food quality and taste. I appreciate it personally for the chef (Mr. Mohammed) doing a wonderful job here. Overall satff behavior and hospitality needs no further feedback, your doing a great job!!!  The room we had was very spacious and well equipped with all essentials. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to my fellow visitors from abroad.  I am a person with greater details; so I must bring to your notice, that, House-keeping team…"
560,40,I find the room is too dark at night. The bed is comfortable but the room is too small for Sheraton Grand. The gym is good and spacious with good stations and weights selection. Breakfast buffet spread is decent with local Indian food. The prata/nan/tosai handsome young chef actually remembered me on the 2nd morning and prepare nice cheese prata for me. The luxury tax is high and adds up to high room rates. 
561,50,"I had a chance to stay at this property twice this year when travelling on business, along with my colleagues.  Outstanding hotel, with great staff: 1. Great property, very well maintained, large rooms  2. Super friendly staff everywhere - reception, breakfast etc 3. Nice gym, if you want to work out  4. Good breakfast included - huge spread of local and international dishes  5. Right across the road from a large mall, which makes it convenient (shopping, more food options, movie hall, department stores etc) 6. Didnt use the pool, but looked like a good one  7. Great service! One of my colleagues had a slightly damp t shirt in the room. They took it, dried it and gave it back in a box - all without asking!! Its these little things that make an experience!!  Will definitely stay…"
562,50,"Uppercut is one of the nice restaurant.  Food  was so good. All the staff was so good,  Especially waitress atashi and chef pankaj  was so good.  We celebrated our KIDS birthday over here.  Fantastic service by atashi , she has a good hospitality skill.  She is so friendly and very attentive.  Salmon was so good.  Thanks for wonderful cocktail  ,I don't remember his name. Thanks to him. Everyone  dng great job. Thanks to everyone.  We will come back again 😊😊"
563,50,"Mr.Amit Katwal from Fnb was very helpful and assisted us throughout the dinner. He has a very good hospitality skill and he is a true asset for your company, keep the good work going on.All the very best Amit...will surely visit again."
564,50,Great stay and outstanding hospitality by the staff! Fabulous restaurants with great food. The breakfast spread caters to several palates - loved the masala chai (spiced milky tea)! Great ambiance and very comfortable and spacious rooms!
565,50,"So I have just spent two days at the Sheraton Grand and I thought I was an A list celebrity throughout my stay. The staff were superb and went an extra mile for everything. I have just had eye surgery so my vision is impaired and they took time to show me round the whole hotel, helped with facilities. Now the restaurant staff - well simply wow! The chef could not be more helpful. On the first day he cooked the most delicious Indian food and the following morning promised to make my favorites off the menu. The staff were so kind and helpful that I felt quite overwhelmed and certainly like I had celebrity status. Room was lovely and clean. Fantastic bedding. Toiletries great and I love when there is separate shampoo and conditioner. Hate when they are all in one. Never works. Pool…"
566,50,"Great stay the entire week. Food was fabulous, staff were courteous & really friendly; smiles all round. Check in & check out times were really quick.I will go back for sure. The overall ambience at reception, open space - superb! The gym was a definite highlight."
567,50,"This hotel is wonderful ! Staff is very friendly. They make everything possible for you to make your stay enjoyable and confortable. They're also very humble, everyone do apologize for example if you wait more than 3 min for check-in or wait for the elevator (who does that anyway ?!). They have 4 restaurants, I went to 2 of them and it's actually very good ! Breakfast is also very good ! And large choice of food.  Room are big enough and well furnished.  2 details that show that this hotel is definitely going above and beyond : - I removed all my clothes from my luggages and left them this way. When i came back at night : I found all my stuff folded in my luggage ! I've never seen that ! - I forgot to turn off the ""do not disturb mode"". I received an email 2 hours later from…"

571,50,"This is my second stay at this Sheraton.  I am a little bit of a hotel snob and tend to book 5-Star luxury brands. Sheraton Hotels do not jump to the top of my global luxury list but this one is an exception.  I originally booked this hotel for its proximity to my office. I was pleasantly surprised by the luxury amenities, the wonderfully accommodating staff and the hotel facilities. Their restaurants are first class, the gym is a full service gym not a work out room and the spa is a fine as some of the best spas in the world. I is a must do.  I highly recommend this property."
572,50,Excellent service great hospitality specific chime staff is very attentive and helpfull great service given by suraj and vickey and one more thing i extremely enjoyed that is cocktail which is suggested by amiya that was gin base ....thanks to amiya for wonderful cocktail thanks to team 😉

574,50,"Absolutely love this hotel and would stay here again for business or pleasure. From the minute you arrive it is clear that the staff value service. Anytime you make a request, they take care of it immediately.   Positives: + Rooms are large with long counter / desk under the flat screen TV, extremely comfortable bed (one of the best), stocked mini-fridge, electric kettle with tea and coffee fixings, good sized safe, iron & ironing board, blow dryer, slippers and robe.  + The shower and bathtub are combined in one small room with glass walls that look out over the bedroom. If you want privacy, you can lower a shade (which I did not do so don’t know how well that works). The hot water is pretty much instantaneous and the shower head is adjustable to your height. The water pressure…"
575,50,"I feel bad that I did not write this review sooner.  The staff at this hotel aims to please!  They make you feel at home and treat you like they really appreciate your business.  Chef MD is the greatest Chef and is the extremely personable.  He will make sure your experience exceeds your expectations.  I can't say enough about him and the rest of the staff.  It has been almost a year since I last visited India, but when I found out that I needed to revisit India, there was no doubt where I would stay.  Last year during my stay, it was my birthday, and the staff made me feel so special; they took pics with me and presented me with a birthday cake.  So, very unexpected, but most appreciated!  My room was spacious and clean, and I loved the fact that the hotel has a pool and…"

578,40,I am a frequent here...extremely happy with housekeeping and other services. Though restaurant service continues to need improvement. Special mention to Purnima from housekeeping. She is a champion of towel art...doll art!! Just when u enter the room after a long tiring day...a cute note and is waiting for u to bring a smile on u...overall experience was good...Sheraton Whitefield remains hotel of my choice
579,50,"This is my third stay at Sheraton Whitefield this year. Just when I think everything is perfect and this is the best place to stay in Bangalore, they continue to find ways to do even better.  Besides the beautiful facility and gardens, what separates Sheraton Whitefield from other top hotels is the pervasive attitude across the entire staff to provide guests the best possible experience.  Staff members stay in the background rather than crowding you, and are always there to help if you just glance or look around for something. I was very impressed with their anticipation, whether it was in the lobby, or the club lounge, or Feast restaurant.  On this trip, Ishvi at the reception and Anuj in the club lounge were particularly helpful and genuinely nice.  My room was good and quiet…"

584,50,"Nice hotel. Very close to many businesses and connected to the convention center. Rooms are larger than the average size you find in other Sheraton hotels. Great location (if you are visiting businesses in Whitefield area or attending a conference in convention center). Also, its right next to a big mall (convenient for shopping) Amazing customer service. The room service went beyond their means to serve us late in the night.   Other than the traffic (to get in and out), there are no other complaints."
585,50,"Without a doubt one of the favorite hotels, I stayed during my corporate grand event in Bangalore. Upon arrival, I was warmly welcomed by the staff. The staff was extremely friendly. We hosted a very big IT event and the support we got from the IT team was commendable. I want to specially thanks to Santosh Naik, Prakash Bhardwaj and Sanjoy Dey from the IT team and they are the true asset to the Sheraton team. I also would like to thank Dipankar from the housekeeping team, executive housekeeper making sure to attend me when I requested for some extra amenities and toiletries for some of my particular need. He extended his courteous gesture and visited me and I liked to see such courteous staff. I also liked his creativity towards making different animals from towels. I liked the…"
586,50,"Beautiful property that is set right in the middle of a lot of businesses and shopping. The rooms are well kept and the service staff is very generous and hospitable.  I really enjoyed the restaurants on premise and there gym is well equipped with lots of space to get a good workout in.   The pool area is fabulous with a very nice appointment of a bar setup. Breakfast at the restaurant here is quite impressive and the quality of the food is very nice.  I didn’t try the spa yet but hope to, it’s a bit expensive so couldn’t review this portion.  Maybe next time.  "

589,50,"I’ve been going to have a couple of meals at Feast for the past couple of weeks. Have to acknowledge the staff for their service and courteousness. The quality of food is good as well. I’ve been to Chime quite a few times and to UpperCut as well, both of which have outstanding menus. Bosco, who served my table was ever the gracious host and ensured I was never left wanting for anything. Will surely come back for more. L"
590,40,"I attended a large technology convention at Sheraton Grand Convention Center, and was impressed by   * the convenience of location - near ITPL and other tech parks and adjacent to Whitefield main road  * efficiency of the staff - managing events, food and beverages for a gathering of a few thousand is done efficiently"

600,50,"I stayed 12 days for a work visit and I only have good things to say about this hotel and the staff working there.  The entrance and flower display is breath taking, and sums up the rest of the hotel. The room was lovely decorated, it was very clean and the small gesture by the room maid every day made me smile. I loved seeing my towel animals when I came back from work every day. The gym is well equipped and it was never crowded which was a bonus. The pool was clean and the area around beautiful decorated. The restaurant serves amazing food, and the staff were so friendly and looked after me so well. Nothing I ever asked was ever trouble for them. I need to give a shout out to Chirasree, Krishnan, Mohammed and Gurpreet who made the stay even better. There was always a smile…"
601,50,"I have been to many executive lounges in Asia, and (apologies to the Marriott Shanghai City Centre), and this is by far the best lounge in Asia. The staff are AMAZING, and the amenities are first class. Breakfast and dinner are full spreads, not a limited choice of meals. Caters to both vegetarians and non-vegetarians - the chef will personally come greet each diner. Also, if there's an entree you want but that they don't offer, they will get it for you - and for sure it will be there the next day. I cannot say enough about the amazing staff - they even knew it was my birthday and sang ""happy birthday"" to me along with delivering a cake. Anette, the manager of the lounge, e-mailed me before my arrival and again during my car ride to the hotel even to welcome me. A million stars…"

We spent a lot of time in the hotel going over certain business discussions and the team always made an effort to help us through the sessions. The food was brilliant as well across the restaurants.

There are too many names to mention, but here are a few who truly stand out:  1. Manisha From the front desk/concierge, was a superstar from day 1. She took care of all my requests, and even went out of the way to secure reservations at a popular restaurant.

I was very worried about food at India but thanks to him there was no problem. He even prepared a Turkish food for us. I would advise new travelers to see Pankash Chef and have a feast.

Friendly staff, great food, small touches like the handwritten note left in the room by the service staff, all make you feel special.  Quite accommodating and willing to listen , this hotel will make you come back again for the experience.  Thanks to the staff and Annette for making me feel at home here.  Well done and kudos to the entire team! I will be back again and there is no better place to stay in the area."

Service was impeccable with dedicated staff focused on our function. The guest relations managers like Illivi and Namrata really went out of their way to ensure everything went smoothly and made us feel comfortable with the settings and efficient service. The food was amazing and delicious as usual. We noticed some dishes were specially cooked for this event, paying special attention to our tastes. Kudos to the chef and the staff. Highly recommended!"
