0,30,The property is very good no doubt but the food is not upto the mark. The housekeeping service was also not good the bed covers had lint I had to her it changed! Rest place is clean and child friendly for sure. 
1,40,Love everything especially the pool. Must visit. We had a nice time here last week. Food and service is great. Serene surrounding and tranquility to explore. Walking around this place itself is amazing
2,50,Nice place to visit for a family dining. Staff are pleasant and food is awesome. You can have a relaxed dinner here. Meet Paramesh at the restaurant to seek some good recommendation on food and service.Restaurant is Opp to swimming pool which makes it even better.
3,50,As an event manager its a nice place to organize corporate events. Staff is very supportive and take care of each and every minute details when it come to coordination with event team.  Place is very nice and interior is very good. Huge swimming pool and lawn space
4,50,We had an amazing weekend stay experience with exceptional and seem-less services offered by Mr. Anupam  & his resort team.Thank you for personally taking care of my group and we are sure to recommend your hotel to our friends & family. Thank you Anupam for great hospitality. We are sure to come back soon and send other friends too..
5,40,"We went to Golden Palms for a team offsite with about 35 people. The overall experience was decent, and they handle a team offsite fairly well. I would not recommend ot for families, since a number of offsites keep happening all the time, and you would be hard pressed to find peace and quiet. The rooms are large and well furnished. Bathrooms are functional and clean. The main selling point are the amenities, very large swimming pools, cricket grounds, baddy courts, indoor games etc. They have equipment for water sports like water polo as well. They have enough space for 4-5 large teams to do offsites. The food is decent, and the bar is well stocked. You cannot bring your own liquor in and they are very strict about this. Overall 7/10 for a company offsite."
6,10,"We have been regular guests of Golden Palms and also have hosted a few corporate events here before. However we were disappointed to see the quality of service going down over a period of time.   We as a family of four visited the property on the 13th November for dinner. Considering the current pandemic, we called them and checked in advance if they were open and if the restaurant was in service. Once confirmed by them, we reached the property at around 8:00 pm and was greeted in the most unsafe manner by the gate-keeper who initially refused to open the gate and then literally popped into our car windows without wearing a mask. We had to request him to first wear a mask and take all safety precautions before getting in close proximity of the  guests.  The actual nightmare…"
7,40,"We recently visited the resort to celebrate our special occasion amidst the pandemic...  It was our first time here !! Huge resort!! Very peaceful - away from all the hustle & bustle of the city... Located in the outskirts of Bengaluru, off-Tumkur Road....  Rooms are large however needs renovation since its a very old resort... Fixtures and fittings, especially in the bathroom need replacements or should be upgraded...  The hairdryer in the room did not work and the door wouldn't close as the door lock had a problem... Dijandas from Housekeeping was very prompt and helpful he helped us shift the room from #198 to #196...  Cafe Solaire was the only restaurant that was operational due to the current situation but we were very disappointed to see the buffet spread choice of food…"
8,40,"I had no issues with anything here. The stay, staff, food, amenities, and everything else was top notch. Love to visit again next year when I am in town. Highly recommend it. Go for it if you are looking for a great stay in Bengaluru."
9,50,We went to this hotel last year. The stay was really awesome. Rooms were really nice and comfortable. We booked two rooms for two families. The pool was also very good and clean. Cleanliness was maintained.
10,40,"It’s a old property with lots of greenery. Located outskirts of Bangalore city and off-Tumkur Road. Only way to reach is by car or cab but it’s a spread out property in a peaceful location, away from all the hustle and bustle of the city.  Rooms are large but needs renovations. Fixtures and fittings, especially the bathrooms need replacements. It’s a resort atmosphere with spa, massage and other amenities and a good place to relax for couple of days. Morning Breakfast is served in the restaurant near the pool but the choice of items in the spread could be better."
11,10,"The outrageously poor service started the moment, our family stepped into the hotel. The rude check-in staff told us that there are no rooms for us, though we booked and paid more than 2 weeks in advance!! After losing an hour at check-in, we were finally allotted rooms by the staff who acted as though they did us a massive favour!!  But the bad experience did not end there!  We went to the bar/restaurant for dinner but were told that it was reserved for a corporate. Ditto for an in-house bar.   If most of the facilities were reserved or booked in advance, then why should we go to the resort?!! They should have cancelled our booking so we did not have to waste so much money in a third-rate resort with poor facilities and rude staff! The crumbling infrastructure is so old and has…"
12,50,"This is an exotic place. Swimming pool, gymnasium is available. Rooms are quite spacious. Conference room is excellent. Vichel is available. Table tennis and badminton playing facilities are available."
13,10,"We had a team outing for about 200 people from our company. It was a huge disappointment and a very bad experience that left us with a very bad taste and we collectively decided never to set foot on that facility again. The place had atleast 9 other groups and was extremely crowded. The wait time to use the sports facility was long, rest rooms very dirty without soap and a garbage bin. Used tissues were thrown around and a plant holder was used as a temp dust bit. But the major thing was how rude and unfriendly the staff were! I spoke to Ms. Sangeetha who had elped with our booking and she was outright rude and started shouting on the phone defending herself claiming it was not her problem. She even went to the extent of saying she did not care what our exprinece was as it was…"
14,40,"yesterday we had a meeting in renaissance race course hotel bengaluru, the ambience what i saw it was really unblievable , food was very delicious, staff was very coperative, and special thanks to rakesh choudhary , sahil ,and arnesh for his excellent service"
15,50,The resort was awesome.  The most attractive place of the resort is the poolside. The staffs are quite Co operative & managed the event quite in a nice way.  The food both breakfast & lunch was good. Thanks 
16,10,"They don't allow you to carry your own liquor in to your room .we had to keep all our items in our car as we couldn't change the program in last minute and ended up paying high price for liquor purchase from them , I have been to many 5 star hotels in India and abroad no hotel had stopped till date for consuming own liquor inside your room ."
17,50,"I had been year last week with my family and had an amazing experience from the time i entered till check out - well equipped rooms with huge swimming pool , awesome food and good gesture of employees was amazing , have to visit this place again. i have to mention Mr.Mandanna who was assisting us in all the Luke corners of our stay and made our stay remember. The sports room with kids play area was interesting part."
18,50,It was a good family outing... The stay at the resort was pleasant & the food was great. Kids enjoyed the pool which is well maintained & huge. Special thanks to Mandanna (FOM)  for making our stay a special one.
19,30,"We stayed here for a day and night with friends. The positives: Excellent location; great ambience and food; friendly staff Not so positives: limited selection of inclusive drinks; poor quality linen- soiled and torn sheets/ bed spreads; average quality rooms; cold, non-heated pools"
20,30,"This is one of the older resorts in Bangalore and I guess my expectations were rather high. Came back a bit disappointed.  Property is small compared to some of the other resorts in Bangalore. The room was okay - large with a veranda. Decent amenities in the bathroom. However, no hand towels or floor mats! And I had to call twice to get the items! Wifi in the rooms was terrible.  The resort is rundown - needs an uplift asap. The conference area is frankly old and the gym, while large, is antiquated! The central park is nice - green and well-kept with a large pool. There is a play area for children and adults with TT, carom, chess etc. While there are plenty of staff I found the service rather slow. No one picks up the phone at the front desk!  Food quality was okay. Also, the…"
21,20,"Our classmates had decided we would have a day of reminiscing our good old days from college and two-generation catch up at the Golden Palms Resort and Hotel  Cons first 1)	The whole group had come together, weren’t informed prior that we had to show some form of ID to get in. Some of our locally staying friends had left their luggage at home and had to get family members to send it via messages/watsapp to show to the front desk. This should have been informed during booking. Our group was great in taking it in our stride in the spirit of getting together.  2)	We had all our bags go through security scanners, even the nuns.  3)	We all friends had decided to get our own alcohol which we were told we couldn’t get into the hotel at check-in. Understand from a business perspective…"
22,10,I checked into the room and started hearing some loud sound of some party.it was an event in the resort center infront of hotel room. After speaking to reception its of no use. They just let in all the business people to organise there the event all along the space and pool. You dont see any privacy or feel like resort kind of environment. Felt like i am in some mall or event. Entire day of mine is wasted. Not much facilities to use in resort except swimming pool.i suggest ppl to avoid this if u want a resort kind of relaxation and day out. Waste of money.i had wasted my amount in paying for membership. Even you have to pay for towels when u use swimming pool.i came twice and both the time some events and disturbance. Families and friends better avoid this place and its for…
23,40,"Visited Golden Palms after a long time. This was a day outing organised by our community group. Since the change in Management things have got better. Nice ambiance, nice food, courteous staff. Besides the time taken to reach & get back this place still has its charm."
24,50,Visited this place for office offsite. Good experience. Buffet spread was quite decent. And with the garden area was hugely spread. Key attaction is the lush green which is easily available in sites in bangalore. This falls in my list to revisit soon though for the calmness and modern architects of the resort
25,40,"Very helpful staff, clean and comfortable rooms, nice resturant with a good choice of dishes, a lot of vegetarian options which were better than the meat options in some cases. The grounds are well tended and the pool looked clean, no hot water in the shower, or it may just have been slow, so I used the provided kettle to warm some water, all in all a very nice place. "
26,50,"had a short stay in this resort last weekend with my family. Located at the outskirts of Bangalore this resort provides everything a boarder can ask for...As the name suggest, the resort is located amidst grove of palm trees and one take a stroll to see the wonderful flora and blossoms of vibrant hue. The rooms are spacious and immaculate. I was awestruck to see the azure pool. Had a whale of a  time in the pool, playing aqua games like water volley. Cafe 'Solaire' is where we had our food located by the pool. A perfect gastronomic delight for a foodie! Staffs were amicable and service was also commendable. In a nutshell if you are looking for a tranquil place away from the hustle bustle, 'Golden palms' is the perfect place to veg out"
27,50,It's worth spending money. The rooms will give a feel of royalty. Great staff service.. Best amunities.. Food was awesome as well.i will recommend everyone to visit the same.. Its not far from bangalore
28,10,"Visited on 11/12 May 2019 along with friends,hoping for a fun filled experience.exactly opp happened. Housekeeping staff couldn't care less. Food was bad & with very limited options. An avid Traveller & have stayed in best of the best resorts but never have had such service & felt cheated to the core. Won't stay here even if given a free stay. They take their clients for granted. Poor service , bad food & no care attitude."
29,30,I stayed here for three days to attend a workshop as part of institute of chartered accountants programme  Rooms are big  Outside area spacious with lot of greenery  Large swimming pool and jogging track  Complimentary breakfast is sumptuous tasty and elaborate  House keeping is poor  Needs renovation since the property is very old  Need to augment their rolling stock like bath towels (on occupancy I had to wait for 8 hours to get my first bath towel)  For relaxing ok to stay  Do not expect modern standards  If you book on deep discount then value for money otherwise not worth paying 
30,50,"My last impression of Golden Palms when I visited a couple of years ago was poor.  I wrote that it was a good property poorly maintained.  My recent visit completely overturned my impression and I found the rooms and the banquet space well maintained.  The attitude of hospitality was also far superior to my earlier experience and overall there was a caring and committed management presence.  I must particularly mention Sahoo in banquets who made our conference experience comfortable and productive with his very competent and caring service.  The restaurant service, as well as front office was warm and friendly.  It is clear that there is an overall cultural transformation for the better.  My compliments to the management and the staff."
31,10,Terrible hygiene .Steam room reeks of urine.  Great decor but dirty bedrooms.  Food made me I'll as buffet is so unsanitary. Do not be misled by posh exterior . Front desk staff are unhelpful though management try to assist.  Great uniformed staff. Lovely grounds but glass by a poolside ? No attention to international or even local hotel standards.
32,40,"Stayed at the Golden Palms Hotel for two nights as part of the organising team of a Rotary District Conference.  The resort is well equipped with rooms, multiple halls of different capacities from 50 to 1000, different to serve Food and Beverages, A wonderful Poolside to have and afternoon brunch or an evening get together. They have good vendors for all the requirements such as entertainment, Audio Visuals (Although on the more expensive side as compared to other vendors), transportation etc.  The check in and check out was handled efficiently, the valet services were quick, the transportation of people and baggage to the rooms through buggies and by foot was well managed. They could have a couple of more buggies to handle large crowds and for travel within the resort.  Food…"
33,10,Attitude of staff is too bad.. no care.. arrogant staff.. treats customer like fools.. never visit this place.. its not worth spending 1700.. totally disappointed with the visit.. food also too bad.. facility is not hygiene..
34,20,"  Pros : Huge property with lots of space to stroll and play.  Very nice pool and its very big.    Cons: Zero Maintainence done.  The hallway stinks and inside the room foul smell of some food. Bathroom fixtures and furniture in the room are not in good condition. You will get Bathroom mat, face towel and TV remote only when requested.  Also if you order something to your room, expect a waiting time if minimum 45 minutes to one hour.    The staff is rude and not well mannered.  The executive at the checkin counter was rude when we asked for the lunch option.  The security supervisor checks your bag every time you go in from the reception to see if you have brought liquor from outside ( As per the hotel policy no liquor is allowed from outside. They scan your bags to dig the…"
35,40,"Nice hotel with a friendly staff, got a good ambience and the swimming pool and jogging track are awesome. The restaurants inside are good food servers and the buffets are intercontinental cuisines and mouth watering"
36,50,"Stayed here for my company meeting. Around 25 kms from Majestic, suggest to take a taxi. Smooth check in.  Wonderful spacious rooms facing swimming pool. You can either walk to room or they have solar cars to reach. One thing that caught attention was the swimming pool, I have not seen such big one.  This resort will surely cater to all' business, pleasure, adults, kids. They have a bid hall on first floor. They do have about 10 plus meeting halls. Food was excellent. Their breakfast buffet was also good with lots of spread. They do have gym and other sports equipment. Also have ground opposite entrance, can play outdoor games. Sufficient parking space for as many cars. Lots of photo opportunities."
37,50,Stayed for 12 days for the Imtex exhibition with group. Staying was very nice every staffs are very helpful. Food was very good with very nice spread of buffet arrangement with delicious range of items to have.
38,50,"Magnificent rooms and services, lovely property to stroll around, good food and ample activities. We went to this place in December 2019 for a wedding and had a pleasant stay. They have spa, restaurant, swimming pool and other facilities. However they do not have a salon service. Since the property is big, sometimes it is difficult for their staff to cater to the room calls immediately. In room service also takes time. However overall experience is pleasant."
39,20,"The hotel is fairly good for a company team outing. Enough space, nice pool....... If the hotel would not claim to be a 5star hotel my rating would be better. However, claiming to be a 5star is completely wrong. There are miles to go to reach that level......(no towels in the room, dirty bedsheets........it would be easy to make a longer list)"
40,40,"We were here for 2 nights to attend a wedding and were pleasantly surprised. The property is very well spread out with ample space, beautiful gardens and greenery. Standard rooms are spacious (better than some of the 5 star properties in India with cramped rooms), comfortable and well equipped. Suites such as Tipu Sultan suite and one other (don't remember the name) are amazingly planned and laid out. Good for a bride to get dressed because they are very spacious.   Pool side is massive. The food we had was the one served at the wedding and it met standards. Room service and service in general is slow. They take a lot of time to tend to you in the room probably because of the vast property and shortage of staff. Maybe a slight problem for older people with difficult in walking…"
41,50,"We had been many time at Golden palm, it's an amazing property. Nice pool, games, restaurant and many other facilities. All the time we enjoyed our outing delicious food excellent service and  cool ambience with huge pool. Mr. Francis and his team very helpful . Will recommend this hotel. "
42,30,"We had visited golden plans along with our friends. While booking it was clearly informed on pool facing . But when checking in non pool facing was given . We had to inform reception as what was promised needs to be delivered . So wasted nearly 1 hour.   Lunch was good but dinner was repetetion of lunch and did not like it . Breakfast was good and variety of dishes was there.  Rooms since we're given adhoc was not upto the mark . Hand towels , bath mat was not kept . Had to wait for more than 1 hr for the  same . Shower was not working asked for a bucket , bucket was so dirty ...did not feel like using it .   Outside liquor not allowed. inside the resort beverages , soft drinks and liquor is very expensive .  Property is good with scenic beauty , pool is nice ..indoor games was…"
43,40,I travel to Banglore regularly and stay in central business area hotels. This time I tried the Golden palms hotel and was happy with my choice. It is located in a very serene area and one felt really relaxed in that environment. The service was just as great . The choice of restaurants and facilities were excellent. Though I did not get to use much of the facilities I specially liked my breakfast experience where I was overwhelmed by the service given by the pampering staff.The stay was extremely pleasant; the staff is very hospitable & the service quality is flawless..
44,20,"The property claims to be a 5 star but in reality will hardly qualify for a 3 star property. The property is old and is not maintained. The rooms are spacious but the furniture is not upto the mark. The mattresses are old and flattened, the shower in the bathroom was clogged, the king bed just falls apart into two with the mattresses not staying in place at all. To top it all the staff is not professional and far from what you would expect at a 5 star place. I was locked out of room for 30 min because the room lock got discharged and it took them 30 min to fix it. The breakfast variety was okay but not great. What spoilt it all was the fact that the breads were clearly not fresh and maybe a couple of days old. The pool is quite big and so is the garden. The rooms also have a…"
45,10,"It used to be a great place for family vacations a few years ago, but not any more. I was completely dusappointed by the quality of rooms, services, restaurant, pool ... all departments. The staff were very unapproachable, the taste of food in restaurant was pathetic while the prices were of5 star rates. Pls avoid if you can... not value for money at all."
46,50,"Our party arrived during April..A pleasant time of year to arrive in southern India.This was our first hotel and by far the most pleasant ..With spacious and comfortable rooms .The staff were both courteous and considerate..Taking great care of the youngest member of our party who is 7 years of age.She spent a lot of her wonderful stay here in the pool!The food was excellent and featured many traditional S.Indian dishes, which are among the best in the whole of the Sub Continent.I would particularly like to make mention of Ms Kajal Singh (banqueting director)who was so helpful in accommodating our party....Wonderful accommodation,wonderful food,wonderful situation..Highly recommended!."
47,50,"I visited this resort over the weekend. There were initial hiccups when we booked over the phone and it was confirmed but when we walked in, the staff had us waiting. We were offered welcome drink only once we made the payment!!!  Anyways, the resort was spic and span. Very courteous staff who drove us till our room. The staff at the swimming pool were very courteous. Rooms were very clean and very nice. Room service was a little expensive. Then the highlight of the day, candle light dinner. This was the most memorable experience my wife gave me and was well organized. Very courteous staff, amazing 5 star quality food and simply brilliant.   I will visit again and recommend this place."
48,40,"I was attending an exhibition nearby and was looking for decent places around. Came across this hotel and decided on it even though I saw mixed reviews. After a 7+ hr drive to the hotel, I was just looking to check-in and get some rest. The elevation and the grand water fountain as we enter the hotel was spectacular.   But troubles started at the time of checkin. I had to wait for 15 minutes because the manager was busy with a huge group of corporate clients. Eventually, the manager Pramod, sorted out the minor issue and I was off to the room. The walk was very pleasant because of the extensive greenery and landscapes. The room is spacious and the bathroom is decent. Free water bottles as well.   The breakfast buffet is near the extra large grandeour pool. The spread was quite…"
49,40,"If you are looking for place to detox yourself from the world and get pampered well check this place out. Big rooms and big resort with all the required amineties,pool,gym,spa,play area with a good area to walk around. You can just check in and relax. Staff are always polite and goes that extra mile to get things done for you. "
50,50,"Hi, stayed here with family for three days and had a great family time together. The details are 1. First, for the package booking (five rooms) was helped by Mr. Surendra. He guided and suggested the right package with inclusions to match our requirement. He upgraded one room to Magnolia Suite with compliments wherein our entire family could spend & enjoy quality time together. Perfect job. Thank you Mr. Surendra ! 2. The check-In was smooth & we were quickly transferred to our rooms by Ms. Nidhi. 3. The rooms are large, spacious & well-lit, especially the suite was big with all the amenities. Bathroom was clean with well-stocked toiletries. 4. The property has a large well-maintained swimming pool, a indoor sports facility with Carrom, Table tennis table, Squash room and…"
51,30,"Apparently, this used to be a classy hotel.... But that was way back in time, before the ownership changed hands. Now, it's more a favorite haunt for corporate off-sites, sales meets, and loud weddings.   The property is interesting landscaped, but the gardens do need more care and attention. The statues dotted across the property are questionable in taste, especially one with a couple of shoddily sculpted horses and a mer-couple.   The rooms are decent, but the bathroom fittings are rickety and seem way past their sell-by date.   The service is terrible. My room had an ironing board, but no iron. Also missing were hand towels and bathrobes. The attitude of the staff is to start with a ""no"" to and request - you have to stand firm and insist on whatever you're asking for before…"
52,50,We were here on a two day offsite meeting. The resort is cut off yet not far off from the airport. The property is well maintained and rooms are spacious and luxurious. We had buffet food which was good with a lot of variety - we had to wait for bread (rotis) on quite a few occasions though - maybe because of the weekend rush.Overall a pleasant stay and quite a good break if required for a day. The staff is courteous and extremely attentive to customer needs. Having all levels of staff have at least understand basic English communication would be an advantage considering they have visitors from all over India. Overall a pleasant stay and would recommend going back !!
53,20,"Visited 3 yrs back and had great memory from room to spa and food, pool staffs and cleaning etc. Now in Sept 18 2nd week when visited and stayed for night was worst ever experience - terribly uncleaned spa pool lawns and perhaps deteriorated from 5 star to roadside dhaba and low class resort. Sports area - person behaves and he is losing his money to give you racket for badminton or tennis to play, game area person is exceptionally bad behaved and rude too. not just me specific - had seen him same way with over 5 families and 1 big group behaving same ways."
54,30,"Reading the reviews of those who visited this resort a year ago, and personally visiting the resort after some time had changed my whole view point about this place. I don't think I was eager to stay here any longer after a day. Like everything has pros and cons, this place has some pros, including the amazing atmosphere and a very well maintained swimming pool, this place has an amazing games area as well and yes, it's fun to play different sports right from snooker to foosball and tennis. Now coming to what this place has in abundance, cons. The food is...... I don't know which word suites it most,... Unedible or disgusting. The food is tasteless and there is not that great a variety in terms of curries and gravies in vegetarian. The entire amazing atmosphere of this place was…"
55,40,I went there for a Team outing.  Pros : 1. Swimming Pool is very big. 2. Breakfast and Lunch Menu is very good. 3. Rooms are comfortable and luxurious with Pool facing balcony.  Cons :  1. Football and Cricket ground is very bad. No maintenance. No sports equipments. 2. House keep service not upto the mark. 3. wen you call Room service they will keep asking you to call on another number instead of just listening and get the work done.  Note : This place has the largest swimming pool in Asia. As mentioned by them in welcome note.
56,40,"We stayed in suite.   A very well maintained room with all amenities.  Details were good and comfortable.   Food good at Badsha and room service.  Paneer tikka, seek kabab , galouti kabab  Plain rice with tadka dal   Veg cutlets amazingly British   Friendly staff "
57,40,"A beautiful resort, best place for family get together, nice place to relax and not to forget the food the best. Beautiful buffet menu and very tasty food. Serene location kids friendly. Excellent and friendly staff right from the reception to house keeping and restaurant staff.  Room maintenance needs to improve.  "
58,40,Fantastic property and a good place for a weekend getaway. Got good discounts booking directly at the hotel. I stayed at a deluxe suite room which was luxurious and very comfortable. The buffet options were good and we had a new menu for every meal. This place has the largest swimming pool in Asia. We had a great time at the pool.  1Less star for the following - the place is not well lit.  - not adequately staffed - house keeping service was bad
59,50,"This hotel is full of greenery and calm nature. its perfect for any kind of stay. staff is excellent. Food is really good. Rooms are very clean. If you have relaxed budget then this is perfect. There are very good amenities like swimming fool and indoor games, you will love this place "
60,40,"Stayed over a weekend with family and friends. I knew that this place is always booked for corporate stays and conferences but still preferred this just because of the kind of response for my enquiry on availability. ...yes, prompt reply, showing interest in guests who are families not corporates and being open to our requests was commendable. Thanks for that, to begin with. The property grounds have been maintained superbly, plenty of greenery around, lots of places to relax. The swimming pool is huggge!!!!!! And clean.  I was not very impressed with the rooms, had to change a room due to cigarette smell. The management must make stricter no smoking policy. House keeping  was a bit lethargic, need to improve on their  efficiency. Food was also not great,, but ok.  Overall, a…"
61,40,Good old resort but maintenance is needed. It is not like the way it was started. Need to improve on qualities like sports activities and internal maintenance. Rooms are good but old fashioned. Need to modernize. But overall the property is good.
62,50,"Recently, we visited this property with two other families and we have a pleasant stay here. I can say it is on par with international hotels I stayed. The rooms are excellent with a private garden and balcony. The food was awesome with good spread as well as quality-wise. Sunday brunch was the best which cannot be missed with unlimited beer and starters. Another highlight is the swimming pool. It was big and maintained very cleanly and other activities we experienced is the Spa which was very relaxing. The staff are very cooperative and cordial and served all the required things. Highly recommended with family or a group"
63,50,"The experience was really good, the staff and their service was top notch. The rooms were perfectly maintained, with complimenting morning breakfast. The pool is good, can be better. Sauna was good with proper service."
64,40,"I visited this resort last year with my family and cousins. I must say the property is huge, situated in the outskirts of Bangalore city. I loved the stay, the rooms are good and the swimming pool is huge. It is pretty peaceful and calm apart from the swimming pool rush on the weekends, kids and family make a lot of noise but that's okay, ain't complaining. Food court is good. I also tried one of the restaurants but the food is okay not so great. Spa is good too. Service is good but sometimes the room service might take a while as the restaurants are far from the rooms, depends on room location. This is a very good resort for family getaways on weekends. A bit pricey but its worth I guess."
65,30,Rooms were clean and tidy.  Food is good but a bit over priced. Pool is huge and main attraction of place. Garden is ok. Not much on property apart from pool and sports complex.  Towels provided were really old and literally torn. Recommend carrying your own. Room service was a bit late (May be due to week end crowd). Nothing exceptional on property to provide the differentiating experience.  More suited for business conference than for couples or families.  Overall felt it’s way over priced for the experience provided.
66,40,"Been to the conference, the place was good, well arranged, rest rooms were clean,food was good, couldn't enjoy much as it was late night, otherwise you could enjoy the place as it's well maintained, only disadvantage is in the outskirts so having late night dinners are not encouraged, it's best to stay over if it gets late, overall it was good."
67,40,I guess the biggest highlight is the swimming pool...wonderful food served...nice one day outing with friends...lot of activities to do...best visited on weekdays to avoid heavy crowds...lawn tennis and squash were also good...
68,50,Good to visit near Bangalore. Resort is very clean and tidy. The Food is very Expensive. Going in group would help to save Money. Nice to stay for a day. They have massage centres as well and all other facilities are really good.
69,40,"Golden Palms is a giant property, with tonnes of amenities for its guests. Lots of fun activities, both indoor and outdoor, good connectivity, good music, very courteous staff. Excellent place to spend a weekend or have a company outing."
70,50,"The Property is a fabulous one on the Tumkur Road. It is about one hour drive from the City with the regular traffic. The Check in is good with a welcome drink. The rooms are really spacious and can easily accommodate a family of three members. The Rooms are well equipped with enough lighting, air conditioning and a spacious sit out (Balcony). The Bathrooms are really clean and the linen for the bed and the bathroom is so neat and tidy. They have a wide range of entertainment in the village opposite to the main resort. There is no facilities for the drivers, where the management has to look upon and improve in this area as all the guests travelling with drivers will find it tough. Over all a superb holiday destination and if you are a group of 20 and above the perfect place to…"
71,30,The resort is a huge property with a huge pool and bar area that beautifully maintained. They do have some indoor and outdoor activities maintained fairly well. The buildings and rooms are old and seem to be not very well maintained. The food is excellent and people are polite. Provided with  electric buggy to travel around the resort area. Decent experience overall
72,50,From very first the view is awesome i never seen this kind of view or i cant imagine too... The staff was good helpful... Such a nice hospitality...  Thankyou for making my stay comfortable...  Will visit again soon
73,50,"One of the best place away from the city to pamper yourself with sports and activities around. This place has everything you would need to relax. From pool to snooker, from tennis to chess, from batminton court to food court."
74,20,"I knew this property through my earlier company association, where we used to have most of the meetings in this property as it is closed to one of our manufacturing plants. After a gap of 2 years, I got a reservation (corporate booking) and stayed for 2 nights.  First of all the response in the reception was horrible.  The female threw the credit card after swiping at the time of check in!!!!  Quality of room was horrible, no latch on the main door, coffee maker was not working and Tatasky connection was not working.  When complained about this, there is no response and I had to survive with all such deficiencies.  They are overbooked by IT companies in Bangalore but that doesn't mean other customers' are less important.  Very arrogant people.  It is a great lesson that I should…"
75,20,I have stayed here several times before. I had hoped it might have had a facelift by now but alas no. It could be so much nicer! It's really very tired now and the gardens are unkempt. The charges should be lowered in line with the steady decline.
76,20,"The landscaping is just about okay.. and not maintained at all. The tables in the conference room were covered by white sheets and under it was insect ridden furniture. The food is really sad. The staff service is like a gamble.. some are okay and some are really rude so, Good luck with that. Don’t take your expat friends there, they might form a bad opinion about India."
77,40,"The property is decent but looks more maintenance is needed. Rooms are well kept, clean, tidy. The lawns are full of coconut, mango and jackfruit trees and it looks lovely passing through these. Swimming pool is huge. Food tastes good. Staff are hospitable. Overall a good experience."
78,40,"nice resort huge swimming pool and spacious rooms  IT has a nice walking track which is around a KM long ,Can visit for a single day stay and experience the location well pretty close to bangalore  overall a good place for short stay"
79,20,Staff we really under trained and poor maintenance because our room was not cleaned well and since there was a water line got punctured there was no hot water at all and pool is no that clean . Good is just ok. I would say may be its good for day outing but dont ever chose to stay. Never !!
80,10,"Property is reasonably ok, facilities are not so great, but staff are not well trained, not polite, no where near to the standard. We had very bad experience at the reception itself because of the miscommunication between thier Sales Team and Duty staff at resort. But they could have handled in much better n smooth way if they are trained professionals. Food at the resort was just ok but expensive. It can be a great resort if they have well trained professionals. "
81,50,"I stayed here for my anniversary and we enjoyed every minute of it. Biggest kids pool, excellent food, and Mandanna's (FOM) hospitality was awesome. We had taken spa services and it was relaxing. Would love to visit again soon. "
82,50,"I visited Golden Palms multiple times now and the experience has been one of the best. We even had a wedding here, and trust me the staff at Golden Palms is outstanding. They make you feel so much at home and everyone is working hard to make you feel special. Well-maintained & always with abundance of tasty food, it is one of the quick get-aways from home!  Do visit the swimming pool - it never ends! Steam and sauna is complimentary if you take a room and it's superb :)"
83,50,"I visited this hotel for couple of days for holiday makers with my family but best things that about very first checking and check out by front office team. Then about restaurant good service is there with good Choice of food. The swimming pool is really big ,,so that we enjoyed a lot.. Great place to enjoy with family.....   And also we got very first checking and check out by Ms. Priyanka. And all the outlet information from her.. Really nice Hospitality.. Thanks to all.... "
84,30,"I went with my wife and a 1 year old kid based on my previous good experience (8 years back). But very sad to see how much the service has gone down. when we checked into our room, it was stinking with alcohol & cigarette smell from the previous occupant. So we called the reception immediately and asked for the room service to come take a look. But noone came. So we called the room service ourself and finally the guy came and sprayed some room freshener. But after 20 mins or so the stink was back so we again called the reception and requested a change in the room to which she said she will check and get back but never came back ! They talk to you nicely but dont care about your concerns. Our stay included complimentary buffer lunch, buffet Dinner & breakfast. Food was very good…"
85,30,"I spend a day at this resort(day-outing package). I was charged Rs. 1500/- for a package consisting of Welcome Drink, Breakfast, Lunch and High Tea plus use of facilities such as lawns, indoor games and the swimming pools.   The resort looks aged and I don't see any validating reasons for it charge the prices that it is charging for the services rendered be it a day guest or resident.   The welcome drink was just flavored sugar water. The breakfast was too basic (more like a simple South Indian meal of idlis, vadas, sambar, chutneys, pooris, boiled eggs etc.)  The lawns were decent enough but requests for drinking water required multiple follow-ups before the staff brought in water canisters for my group.   The lunch was again too basic and I felt the resort was taking me and my…"
86,50,"We visited this place last weekend. It was a short trip - an overnight stay. We stayed at the Deluxe room. The rooms are big and the bathroom too. We had this room in the ground floor and a balcony with 2 garden chairs and a table. You get to use free WiFi too. Plush greenery all around, tall palm trees and lots of flowers. Lots of antique furnitures. Balinese Spa was really nice, relaxing for almost 2 hours followed by steam bath. Super Large swimming pool and there you have Cafe Solaire open 24 hours where have a large sizeable buffet. Food is really tasty, delicious and very enjoyable. You have the Baadsha restaurant beside the pool where you get to try the famous night-market styled Lucknowi cuisine from the Awadhi region of Northern India. We tried Gulnari Kebab and Pomfret…"
87,50,"We were about 25 of us attending a workshop at this resort which is about 30 km from Bangalore. The place is massive with a huge swimming pool (claimed to be the largest in India) - golf carts are available for movement within the resort. They have 14 conference halls and about 150 rooms which are housed in two storeyed buildings - in case of mobility issues, guests should request for ground floor rooms. Breakfast, lunch and dinner spreads were awesome. The rooms are fairly large sized and reasonably well maintained although the buildings could do with some paint makeover.  Definitely recommended for either a quiet weekend getaway or for company functions."
88,30,A very spacious property but appears aged and needs modernisation keeping its charm. Lovely water area and garden. It is very nice to walk over water bridges specially after evening. Wish there was a ramp also for convenience of seniors .
89,30,"Golden Palms Hotel & Spa has great location and infra. Over a period of time cracks have started to appear in Quality. From what it use to be few years back and what it has become today reeks of maintenance gone awry. Food is above average, room service is extremely delayed, many fountains have stopped functioning. Improvement needed for this can still be turned around and can regain its past glory!"
90,30,"Visited for a business conference , avg property but nice & clean, looks very old, rooms and some areas need renovation strongly, food was ok, Pool was nice but the pool incharge was very not polite . House keeping services were worst . Rest nothing great, no where near a 5 star property ."
91,50,"Golden Palms Hotel and Spa is a very great resort to go near Bangalore outer area. Just 1 to 1.5 hrs from Bangalore City.  I love the swimming pool, so big and so clean. Well maintained. Kudos to the Swimming Pool Maintenance Team. Kids will love it. This is the best and biggest swimming pool i have seen in entire India. I bet! The foot path around the resort is very green like a mini forest, you'll love it if you're a nature lover. Large variety of flora and fauna.  The room are posh and big, fully furnished. One Hall with 1 Bedroom . 2 Bathrooms. I like the sliding grass dors in both the rooms, you can open it to glaze the swimming pool or the posh garden with tall trees and plants. My family enjoyed the private lawn in the backyard of the room. very PERFECT!!! for kids and…"
92,30,"I have mixed reviews about this hotel.   What i loved is the rooms. Once you cross the reception, there are lush green internal roads towards the blocks. Each block is g+1 and the ground level rooms come with a veranda and the first level rooms come with a balcony. All the rooms on each level is connected with a long veranda. Very well maintained rooms and bathrooms. Maybe over 420 rooms.   Whats not great is the arrival experience. Looks old and run down, internal roads not well maintained, shabby lobby entrance with old format notice boards with multiple A4 size printed notices. But once u cross all that its so pleasant. Calm and quiet.   Beautiful garden, pool, there is outdoor sports as well.   F&B is okay, not great not bad. Service staff extremely polite but room service…"
93,40,"It was a nice place, yummy food, nice amenities, nice location, nice hospitality and a big swimming pool to enjoy. Overall it's a great trip with the team. Bit expensive though liked the place. Thanks."
94,50,"Beautiful place, well maintained, food is average. Bit expensive, but worths a visit for the experience, can see variety of plants in the premises. Dinner at pool side with kids running around the pool was fun"
95,20,"Old club type invested in resort where you need to expect less luxury. Rooms are quite average decent. Bathrooms was average as shower knot was not working properly. Very far from city which makes this a remotely located hotel. Breakfast is below average, as i was a vegetarian so less options. "
96,40,The facilities and grounds are large and spacious. Things are getting quite old as I understand this resort is close to 20 years old so things are quite dated and old. Service is acceptable but the thing that stood out for me is the food quality is quite good for such a resort.
97,50,Golden palms has an excellent property in the out skirts of Bangalore city. the swimming pool of the hotel was huge and a unique one i loved the pool and enjoyed a lot at the lush green atmosphere of the hotel. The hotel is a good place to spend with the family.
98,50,The place was coruscating with bewitching resplendance of greenery The delicacies served were truly tempting The hotel has has every facilities that is needed to sustain a wonderful adventurous vacation Also the cleanliness and hygein were highly maintained  The place is quietly peaceful and is surrounded by greenery and forest land which adds to the beauty of this place Also the decorations were mesmerising and gives a little Arabian touch
99,40,"It was a pleasure staying in golden palms hotel.     The service and courtesy from the security guards, reception staff, restaurant staff, bar staff, housekeeping staff  is exemplary.    Golden palms  is  secure, safe hotel with the good environment surrounded by trees and I would have no hesitation in staying here again or recommending it to any of my friends or family.    Thank you very much indeed and Namaskaram"
100,30,The resort is easily accessible via Tumkur road.  When we reached the resort there was nobody to guide us to the parking area.The Front desk took some time to hand over the room keys. But there was no one to guide us to the Room. We were finding it difficult to locate the room carrying our luggage and roaming in the resort. Thanks to the guy with electric passenger vehicle who stopped and helped us to the Room. The room we stayed was clean but we felt the rooms in resort are too old and badly need a renovation.   The food menu for the room service is too expensive (Better to go to the restaurant and have food to save some bucks) There are 3-4 restaurants inside the Resort but 3 of them were reserved for the Groups/Companies. So we had only one option(Cafe Solaire). We tried the…
101,10,"Check in  and Room availability: 1.	Check in time was 12 pm. We reached at 12:30 pm. Initially they said check in time is 1 pm and we have to wait. When we showed our voucher, they said, room is not ready and it will take an hour. 2.	We booked for 2 rooms(2 families with a kid) and was clearly mentioned that they will provide King size bed. After 2 hours(around 2 pm) only one room was provided and for the other rom they said it will be ready by 4 pm. 3.	We took one room and found there was no King size bed (instead 2 single bed). We had kids and we asked for king size bed again. For King size bed we were asked to wait till evening 4.	Kids were already exhausted. We had no option than to take whatever rooms available.  Food  Lunch: 1.	Buffet charges was INR 1000 +GST per plate.…"
102,40,"Golden Palms is a great place to have a get together with a small / large group of friends. Great location - quiet yet reasonably near to Bengaluru. The rooms, the pool and the conference facilities are well laid out and can comfortably take a business conference. Some of the furniture is a bit dated and needs some maintenance but not a bad place to go to."
103,10,Visited in January 1st week. Was really disappointed. Here are the lowlights: 1) The room service was bad. Got spoilt tea in morning. 2) saw rowdies creating ruckus in pool and then it was unusable as it got dirty.  Avoid going to Golden Palms resort. 
104,40,"This is a resort having one big field for all kind of activities to do weather for family or for corporate outing.  Service is good & maintaining the timings for the same.  Food is good, restaurant is far from the reception."
105,40,"The place is huge with good rooms, i was at the Tipu sultan suite. The breakfast and meals were good though the service was very slow. We were a group of 60 so waiting for meals was an issue and last of seating place during lunch was a problem. The property is huge so we could plan our events and training well. Even though there were atleast 2-3 other groups the arrangement was well managed, even though the checkin takes time. Other groups had planned a pull party so it was very very noisy for us. I would say this a good place if u are on a corporate offsite. wont recommend for couples of fly holidays as its too noisy and crowded.."
106,20,"Stayed at golden palms for 31 night new year eve with family and my infant. Had high expectations on service and quality, but was dis appointed. I spoke with resort manager, he admits that due to new yr eve, all staff are busy with preparations and hence they were unable to focus on guests. Some un-happy points - made us wait in lobby for 45 mins saying room is getting ready - when we went to the room, keys were not working. Again had to wait for 30 mins - room was not tidy enough ( I had certain expectations as I was charged 12500 Rs per night ) - basic essentials in room was not available - resort accounts guy calls up multiple times and says to complete billing before 31st night as he has to finish his billing in yr 2017 :D  No value for money at all, not worth 12.5 k"
107,10,"We have been to many resorts and hotels in many countries incl. India over the years, and I can say with full confidence that this was our worst experience ever, so much so that we actually left the resort within 24 hrs of our check in.   1. Check in: The check in process was a sign of things to come. It seemed like they were not organized because they couldn't find our reservation for a bit. Then they asked for our Aadhar cards/passport for all people staying (4 of us) and would not accept our PAN cards. Thankfully we had a soft copy, and that saved us!  2. Rooms: We were taken to our rooms, and they are very underwhelming for a resort of 5-start quality. As soon as I entered I noticed the previous owner had left a used plate on the table in the balcony which I pointed out to…"
108,50,"This is an amazing resort with all possible amenities and facilities. > A must for family, friends, couple, office outings. > Swimming pool is amazing with fresh water. > Drinks are good with affordable prices. But beware, the local bar tenders may charge extra. > Go in the morning and have a bright day with indoor and outdoor games. > Take all food and drinks stuff as you won't get any shop nearby. > Food is above average."
109,50,"Stayed there for two days and thoroughly enjoyed. The property is huge filled with greenery. Had a wonderful morning with lots of plays and activity organised by hotel guys. The food was wonderful and a lot of varieties. The pool side restaurant  was amazing and the pool was huge, the center of attraction of the property i must say. Service is five star. Rooms are big but old and must need a renovation i guess. All in all a nice experience."
110,50,"Visited this awesome place on 3rd Nov, '17 and I must say that the experience was indeed amazing. The large swimming pool, variety of cuisines for breakfast, the arrangement for DJ, Live orchestra, everything was just above par. A must visit place if you are ever visiting Bangalore."
111,20,"We stayed with friends and family over a 3-day weekend trip out of Bangalore. This place had a halo of being once owned by Bollywood personality Sanjay Khan, who very passionately managed this place and built a reputation around it. We were expecting at least basics to be there. However, the entire stay left us regretting our decision. There are loads and loads of things to improve.  Pros: 1. Amazing potential with spacious rooms, infrastructure, grandeur.  2. Well-maintained garden. 3. Live counter in buffets  Cons (areas of improvement): 1. The check-in process itself. They asked for govt ID cards for all of us when we checked-in. We booked the place 1 week ago and this could have been intimated or taken care of earlier. It took 30mins just to check-in! 2. Maintenance: Very…"
112,30,"Stayed here for a day as part of a corporate group. The property is fairly large, and the pool is the attraction. The gardens are good for a walk as well. Property shows clear signs of aging. Food is just about passable - breakfast was terrible. You don't get Uber/Ola easily, so make sure you book a cab thro' the hotel's travel desk. The games room is quite small for a property this size."
113,40,We were a group of 25 friends with families wanting to have a reunion to celebrate 25yrs of friendship and Golden Palms was the perfect place for us! We enjoyed the hospitality and food and other facilities at the property. Kids and adults alike had a wonderful time especially at the pool and other sporting facilities there. we had booked rooms for an overnight stay and the experience was quite good with well appointed staff who were very helpful. The food was good too ! looking forward to visiting again.
114,40,"The property is far away from the city's hustle and this a great place for a weekend getaway  In a City that is all about trends, fashion and Techy people this is a great place for hangout, relaxation with its nature themed environment and all the arrangements are perfect with a great team to execute every request of the guest and a place which kids will absolutely love to spend with the pool and many activities for them to keep them enjoying there vacation & also couples can have a great time as well, with nature's peace   I would suggest everyone to visit the place before they deiced, and guarantee that you would fall in love with this place"
115,40,"It's about a km from Makali on the huskur road. Valet parking  is available here.  The pool is the main highlight of this place. Swimming costumes are mandatory. There is also a badminton, tennis, squash court, Foosball, car room chess and other indoor activities.  Outdoor, they gave a tug of war rope. Also they have open spaces to conduct games. Food is OK. Service has improved over the years.  Good place to hangout for corporates and families. Rooms were average. Could be maintained better. "

119,40,One of the very good place i have seen for stay and enjoy your time here. we have spent very good quality time with our group during our stay. The hotel stay was awesome and really memorable. The food taste was also good.
120,30,"Stayed at The Golden Palms Hotel and Spa over the weekend from Saturday30th September through Monday( 2nd October,Gandhi Jayanti). It was a long weekend with Monday being off; the hotel was fully booked. I travelled with 2 friends and booked directly with the hotel.  Check- in formalities were carried out smoothly and quickly. We were allocated a room on the ground floor with pool view, near their restaurant; Cafe Solaire. The room was spacious with a sit out, the fridge in the room was not working, nor was there a mini bar.  The bathroom was spacious too but the shower door did not seal tight and hence the water would flood the dry area of the bathroom.   What I liked:  1.Spacious property nice to stroll around large enough to walk/jog . 2. lots of flora however it would be…"
121,50,"Had been at Golden Palms for nearly two weeks for a project offsite. Overall experience was very good.  Positive: Calm and quite environment, very conducive for focused work. Many conf rooms are available and can accommodate large teams. Friendly and accommodating staff. Good restaurant (Cafe Solaire). Chef and managers paid personal attention to ensure that team is not bored of the options. Large swimming pool. Location is very close to NICE and Nelamangala road intersection. Hence commute time from city is relatively less. 24x7 WiFi is available.  Areas of improvement: Due to hectic work, could not enjoy other facilities at resort. Options seems to be limited for engaging children if you are going with family."
122,40,"We had gone as a team of 70 people to Golden palms. Even though there were other companies on their team outings, we did not feel congestion as the property was big enough. The rooms were well maintained with fresh towels and toiletries. The lunch buffet was ordinary but the breakfast had a large number of options. It has one of the largest swimming pools which is maintained well."
123,50,"Food is really awesome here.. moderately large swimming pool to have fun..a good sports complex and cricket ground.. All and all, I would definitely recommend you to go there. It's one of the resorts that I really enjoyed visiting.."
124,50,"Was their last week with the family and friends, amazing place to be in. Superb ambience and highest level of hospitality, Swimming pool is a highlight and super delicious food..... Strongly recommended resort in and  around Bangalore."
125,30,"The rooms are spacious and neatly maintained. Pool view rooms are good. It has a very big and long swimming pool. The restaurant has many cuisines like Indian, French and etc.It has a good spa to experience the relaxation. A big luxury location to hang out with family. The pool is clean and neatly maintained."
126,40,"Had been to this place as part of Day Outing program and wow...its so nice, silent place to relax and have fun - amidst lot of greenary and a huge huge pool!! Loved it! Only thing is the 'games' part is quite limited and they can expand it if the management gives a push!"
127,10,"Looks great on the net but the place is pretty poor. Food is average, People are a bunch money eating greeters. for everything u have to pay, if you planning to play cricket, shuttles then you have to pay for ball, swimming pool care taker is very rude, for small - small thing he will shout like he is paying us or free of cost we went there and swimming. in very sort i can say that noting is there to enjoy for team outing"
128,50,"It's awesome place to stay and relax . Rooms are specious and service is very good . I like the food quality . Pool side having enough space to relax and enjoy . You can also conduct office conferences very well , they are having good banquet .Overall very good experience ."
129,40,"Our club had a picnic on 3rd September at the Golden Palms Hotel & Spa. The property is huge and sprawling. So if you are not used to walking a lot, this is not the place for you. Just kidding! They have electric buggies.  We spent time at the pools, yes they have multiple. Swim, play water polo or get your toddler to start his swimming lessons. They have a pool room, a tennis court and a badminton court. So you are pretty much covered.  The restaurant had an incredible spread for both breakfast and lunch. Both Indian and Continental. The egg counter was a huge hit during breakfast, while it was the pasta counter that was popular during lunch. Apart from the standard Indian fare, they had an amazing range of salads and health options. I chose a spaghetti with white sauce and an…"
130,10,Never stay at Golden Palm Spa and Resort for the following reasons:  1. They are not GST compliant they will provide you the Bill in their fixed format.  2.Front Desk staff and even Manager is hopeless and they don't know how to converse with the clients.  3. On first day they will provide you the worst room in which A.C. doesn't works .  4.As soon you reach first floor to your room there is garbage placed and as it was stinking it seems their housekeeping staff has not visited that floor from 15 days.  5.Their kitchen exhaust makes noise like any any road construction is going on.The worst part some of the rooms in their Gazania Block are on their Poolside kitchen facing .Very Pathetic noise and view.  6.Food menu have limited options and not up to mark as per their pricing. …
131,40,"Our company organised an outing to this place where we stayed for a night. They have good premises to host a party for a 100+ crowd, buffet place and ample rooms. Their food was delicious, tidy rooms and swimming pool. Everyone enjoyed."
132,40,"U gotta go there! Hospitality is at the top of their list of things to do! Food variety in their restaurant is superb. Swimming pool is the largest I've ever seen - but no diving. Hotel security is most reassuring with agents constantly patrolling. Area is a huge high-walled rectangular formation with lovely garden walks and featuring numerous kinds of crotons and tropical trees. Some 150 rooms and 300 guests can easily be accommodated. It's a long way from the airport, and a Metered-taxi is a must! - takes about an hour, more, during business trading hours."
133,50,"the Golden Palms Hotel & Spa is located in Golden Palms Avenue, Off Tumkur Road Hobli, Tumkur Road, Bengaluru.stayed for 2 days with my family. rooms are good but not food and neatness. very discussing food i have seen."
134,30,Rooms are stacked along a  800m  rectangular perimeter.The middle area has dense plants and coconut trees at the top followed by a huge pool and ends with a restaurant. There were many teams from different companies ( for training) and all the areas were crowded. Rooms are luxurious. Could not see many families ( with kids) or couples.
135,20,I stayed at the golden Palm as a part of my team outing. The place is certainly not worth the hype around it and the prices are just too high for what they have to offer. Breakfast at the restaurant... A dead fly was stuck on the bread with many other flying around (0 for hygene ) the infrastructure looks old and slightly run down. I would seek to go to a better place and not there for the price they are charging.  
136,10,"We went for drinks on the pool side restaurant.  We ordered 100 pipers (12 years) full bottle as we were 7 people. They asked for 8500 Rs. Original price of this bottle is 1600 Rs. They counted per peg (30 ml) price multiplied by 25 pegs and gave us this rate. We informed HONOURABLE MR KRISHNAN, the Manager at The hotel. He said He  could give in 3000 Rs if we inform them by email. But without informing by email charge bottle would be 8500 Rs.  What a rubbish answer and rubbish management system..  They then referrred us membership plan. We were ready to take membership also which was worth 9000 Rs but then on this bill they didn't want to give membership discount.. They simply here to loot people. Such a rubbish management policy.  Highly non recommend this property."
137,50,it was the amazing experience at golden palm resort !! i had been there to attend a destination wedding ! the aura of the resort was wonderful ! the amenities of the resort were well maintianed and loved to use the same ! the food quality is best and many variety of restaurants are available in the resort ! it was a amazing experience at hotel !  Swimming pool and Bar were a great to watch ! beautiful scenery !
138,40,I was booked in Room 198 on first floor. I was part of group of more than 20 people. The room had excellent pool view.  I will say it is nice but somehow I did not feel that warmth. Everyone works mechanically though efficiently but the feel of human touch was slightly missing maybe due to huge party that they were organising. The food was nice in their coffee shop. The biggest precaution one should take is that if one is sitting in the balcony please ensure that the door to balcony remains open otherwise you will be locked in balcony and any help will be at least 25 minutes away. You have to shout to draw attention of any passerby who will then inform the reception. The person will then take some time to come as it is fairly large complex. I think this hotel is not disabled…
139,40,"Very co-operative stops, outside city and quite calm place  to stay. Really love this place, and a place where you can relax with family and burn the stress out. It has lot of greenery around and is a good place to have some spa therapy, use the amenities. Good sport activities and relaxing stay."

141,30,A good place outside Bnagalore for team outings. The food is not that good. Its a huge luxurious place with a huge swimming pool. There are many facilities both indoor and outdoor games. There is a lawn tennis court as well.
142,40,"The ambience and the facilities are excellent. The place is out of the city limits and the approach to the property is not very good. You have to travel inside about 2 kms from the main Tumkur road, on winding roads passing thro industries and village. Once you are inside the property it's a totally different world and experience.  Cost wise it is on the higher side and not for the regular visits."
143,30,the place is huge and good. but some staff like their sports incharge  does not have professionalism.  The billiards table is all torn up. The TT bats are tored. The long tennis court had no marking. The sports incharge is not available in the   sports area where he has to be. 
144,30,"Stayed for 1 Night in January 2017 for a Seminar. Facilities are decent, nothing to rave about. Disappointed with the Food Taste...   Rooms are Large and so is the resort. Both are decently maintained but need big time renovation.  Will never stay there again."
145,40,"We had a team training session over three days. The stay, banquet ceremony as also the meeting went very well. The last day being a Sunday was very crowded with day visitors. We did have a nice time. Food, pool and the activities were enjoyable. "
146,50,Superb resort with all the facilities. Ambience is really nice. Have a big swimming pool. All kind of indoor and outdoor games are avail. Food is tasty. Very good and luxury rooms. Been here more than thrice for office outing. Very good place for a day outing as well.
147,50,"I stayed in this resort on 27th of May with my family.  Very friendly and helpful staff. Well maintained room, and other facilities. My special thanks to Mr. Mandanna(FOM) who made our stay special with his great hospitality.  Love to visit again...."
148,50,"A well maintained resort once owned by the renowned Bollywood Actor Sanjay Khan this resort has one of the biggest swimming pools in India, with a Studio themed Bar and nicely landscaped gardens and plus greenery this property is  surely one of the best resorts in Bengaluru for both Family and Business Trips.The variety of food they offer during the breakfast,lunch and dinner is just awesome.This resort has one of the best equipped gymnasium i have ever visited. will recommend this resort for a short weekend stay on a week long or a month long business trip."
149,40,"Firstly, have never been to a resort with such a huge pool. The resort is well maintained. The room was having good ambience. Though the food (breakfast & lunch) on expensive side, I would say its definitely worth your money for what they are offering. We had been for a day stay outing on a Sunday and overall it was wonderful experience and day well spent."
150,50,"Very friendly and cooperative staffs, place is well maintained... Food quality is too good, worth the money... Well experienced Spa personnel and well equipped gym... But some services has to be improved..."
151,30,The food is served in Golden palms. Quality of resort is also good. But the staff does not have hotel management etiquettes. Sports and Swimming coaches think themselves as boss of the place and treat very badly. They have defined their own sets of rules and want every one to follow that.
152,20,"I visited Golden Palms, Bangalore in May 2017 for a 3-day Corporate program!  Its listed as a 5-star/4-star property on all travel websites, but its actually not worth than anything more than a 3-star property! I find it quite overrated!  WHY STAY : Stay for the beautiful compound with nice garden and huge pool area! WHY NOT STAY : The rooms are quite average! Multiple Power cuts were there, though it restored soon! Keys were not working twice during my stay! Reception is very far from the rooms so you have to wait if you order for any service for room! Entire hotel is on duplex concept so spread across a large area!  OVERLY PRICED : The hotel looks lavish on website but once you stay, you will realize its not value for money.  FOOD : Restaurant  options are there , but food is…"
153,50,"When I stepped into Golden Palms Hotel with my family I left one world behind. Very nice place to stay in Bangalore. The space is breezy, pleasant and peaceful feel like an oasis of peace in a busy City . In evening if you sit near pool side you will love the ambiance around. The staffs are very friendly and more than willing to help you. They made my family feel at home while being far away from home. Rooms are specious, comfortable, quiet, and clean.   I simply loved the food here. Loved the place and highly recommend a stay there."
154,50,"One of the best experience in Bangalore.Good food ,service and very helpful staff.Check in was smooth and fast.The best part was food and the leisure activities the resorts had.Highly recommended for both families and business purposes.Will visit again"
155,50,Me and my friends went on a day out on Sunday. We had had a great time there. The pool is very big and properly maintained. We loved the food. They had a huge range of veg and non veg food with awesome starters. Specially the Chinese food at Hidden Dragon was too good. We also went to the spa and had a great experience. It is a lush green and beautiful property and very good for leisure stay with so many varieties of entertainment and sports.
156,50,"I was looking for a place where I can spend some relaxed time with my family after my hectic work schedule last month . i wanted to be in a place that will have somebody for all my family including some good exotic delicious food . And without doubt I can tell you the experience was beyond what I thought at Golden Palms resort - An Extotic Resort outside the busy traffic zone , palacial feeling in the rooms , great amenities to get entertained especially experience in the one of the largest  Swiiming pool was beyond my expectation . This was complemented by great food especially Biryani and Awadhi food sitting in the moonlight near swimming pool was my family enjoyed and would love to go again and again . I was amazed to see the Chef came back to my parents & Kids asking about…"
157,50,"Comfortable cottage type rooms facing towards lush green garden view, huge swimming pool with a nice serene bar and wow food.  They have a Badshah restaurant Operates in the evening serves Awadhi Food, Awesome Kebabs and Biryani, Very Authentic Awadhi Food. The resort as find packed from the people around with so many corporate.  We were on leisure trip. There was a big wedding also for the same two night three days and every where can be seen varieties of food being served.  staffs were very informative and taking care. Spa is Awesome. They have a one of the largest Spa and all therapists are extremely good one. We took 04 Spa treatments in Two days. Worth to spend. In Spa, Ayurvedic treatments not expensive as we thought which normally in five star resorts"
158,10,"Nothing seems to be right with this place...  Post checking at 12:00 pm Basic things were missing like towels, room slippers, hand towels washroom kit... When called reception informed that everything will be up by 4:00 pm..!!! Lol... So they were expecting us to wait till four...!!!! No one speaks in proper English, so if u know kannada then it's good otherwise forget communication with these fellows... Overall it's good property but with very poor management... I feel its too big for them to manage...."
159,20,"We celebrated one Of Our Friends B'DAY. To be Really frank, the Service did not match with the looks of the resort.   1. Poor Room Service  2. Not so great Food.  3. Well maintained Pool. 4. Great Ambiance.  5. Well Spread Greenery."
160,10,This was my 3rd visit to Golden Palms and I must say that it will be the last one! The property is nice and big and the swimming pool is good..but the good news ends here.   Right from the time we arrived we knew that we are going to have a horrible stay..some big fat Indian wedding had just got over and the decorations were being pulled down..making the whole place a mess. There were too many corporate lunches in the coffee shop leaving no place for guests to sit and eat..all tables being reserved for companies! Where do the guests sit and eat??? The food was bad and priced at Rs 1250 per head..too expensive for the kind of food served..should have been priced at no more than Rs 500/ head.  Coming to the rooms..very shabby decoration..looks like no renovation has been done for…
161,10,Very badly managed. Food quality was very very bad. Do check with this resort that there is no wedding function in resort during booking period (if you really want to come in this resort). Otherwise it will be really horrible to come here and relax.
162,30,The hotel building is nicely designed in a huge area full of greenery . The rooms are well equipped with all a traveller would normally need . The property is old and several places need renovation / modernisation . However the service staff is very friendly and efficient and the food at the coffee shop good . The swimming pool is very big and there are a lot of leisure activities .
163,50,"I stayed here in Feb this year, the hotel is very nice. Check in process was quick, good rooms, lush green gardens and huge swimming pool. Poolside restaurant was nice and food was good.  The front desk staff is very polite and professional, thank you all keep up the good hospitality. Will be back soon with family this time."
164,50,"My wife surprised me on my birthday to this resort on a day-out experience and the experience itself was awesome !!  We booked the day-out package for Breakfast-Lunch-Hi_Tea, was initially reluctant to go here thanks to the reviews on the resort for bad service and rude behavior of the staff but then thought of giving a try.  When we arrived at the gate we were asked just one question, ""Do you have a reservation?"", my answer was yes and were let in without any further questions. We didnt have to even go to the reception for check-in as a display board at the front of the reception building welcomed us and directed us for Breakfast. The breakfast spread was vast ranging from Continental to Indian; bacons, sausages, baked beans, bread, pancakes with Maple syrup, Upma, Idli, Vada,…"
165,40,"Away from the huzz and buzz of the city, this resort is a nice place to have a quiet weekend. Their buffet breakfast is nice. They have a nice pool and lot of open and tree lined spaces to stroll around."
166,10,"This hotel is Improperly rated as a five star.  The pool had 6 inch black fungus ring around the edge.  Our room was dirty, human hair on the pillow, no towels, security lock on door broken.  Fight outside our door at 2 am.  Buffet meal not kept hot enough to insure food safety.  Grass long and not mowed.  Air conditioning did not cool the room.  We checked in after 10 pm and were too tired from traveling to change hotels that night or we would have left immediately.  This property is miss represented and miss managed."
167,20,Was on a business trip this February. Rooms are comfortable but service is very unprofessional. The property is quite spread out so definitely needs better signage guiding residents around. Food spread is decent.
168,10,"With high expectations visited this property for a company program.  Very old property, not maintained properly. Rooms and toilets have stinking smell. In fact there is no lock for wash room in most of the rooms. Food items also not that great.  House keeping service is very pathetic. Rooms are not cleaned and no amenities kept in the room. Even for bath towel & Soap, it took more than 1 hour to serve.  Customer service also very poor.  What is the use of having huge property, without proper comfort level? Not worth it."
169,40,"they have good set of amenities for day outing.  Squash court, tennis, table tennis, pool, carrom, badminton, cricket, football, volleyball, water volleyball, and many other activities to be performed. we were welcome by welcome drink, then breakfast. After BF we performed indoor and out door activities and later had lunch. After lunch we went into pool and completed our day outing with high tea. Breakfast and lunch was good, with sufficient quantity of food. It's well maintained resort.  One thing you need to take care is carry a pair of nylon cloths, as they strictly don't allow cotton cloths."
170,50,"I stayed at this beautiful place during the 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas this January.  It is a beautifully laid, well spread out place with comfortable rooms and good food.  Since it is out of town, you can evade the notorious Bengaluru traffic and at the same time enjoy the peaceful surroundings. It's an eco-resort with lots of green space and polite staff.  Hugely recommended!!!"
171,40,"Visited this place in February, group size around 350 employees for a night. Good experience, even with such large group, they were able to do a good job. Rooms are nice and the pool is good. Liked the food as well. Have done events in most of the large properties in Bangalore and around, the real test of these resorts is when you have to manage such large group and the activities and Golden palms did a good job. It was pretty smooth, staff was responsive and no issues with the billing as well.  Recommened for team outings"
172,40,"The unending canopy of coconut tress is heavenly soothing .Well curated resort : Big & Beautiful.Rooms are nice,staff is very helpful.But the food is not proper.Lot of improvement in food quality & taste is required.Reputed properties like Golden Palm are not expected to compromise on food aspects.Vast swimming pool & recreational activities like lawn tennis,volley ball,table tennis make the resort more happening."
173,30,Resort is good and vast . Nice swimming pool and bar . Breakfast was good . But the food that was arranged for lunch was not tasty and I did not like it . Food was spicy was not as per my taste . Limited variety for the money spent by the company
174,50,"Visited on 26-2-17, Sunday with my better half. Based on the multiple bad customer service and room quality reviews I was very doubtful about this resort but I did have a great experience while I was here frm the start till the end. Chkd In at 1 pm my room was ready and did not have to wait, they did ask for 2k as security deposit for wch I had to run to the ATM as I wasn’t going to let them write my Crdt Crd details down. The # was 105 located on the ground floor left of the reception. Well guarded by lots of security guards .  As I am a member of this place I had a coupon for buffet but I was informed that it wasn’t valid for Sunday lunch and it was mentioned on the back of the voucher, cant blame them I missed thr fine print. Did have to pay 2600 Rs after the discount of 20%…"
175,40,"Swimming pool is huge. Facility is very good and spacious. For the size of the facility, the games area is quite small and you will have to wait for your turn most of the times.  Food is decent. Rooms are pretty good"
176,30,"We had a team offsite planned in this place, while the rooms are decent and it's a beautiful property, it's really far off from the main city.  Also the toilets were not clean, the housekeeping needs a push. The place could be wonderful if they gave attention to things like clean bathrooms in the lobby area and the food as well. Good served during breakfast and lunch was mostly cold."
177,40,Had a very nice experience staying there with family and friends.the property is quite well maintained and calming.spa services are the cherry on the cake.i felt its a piece of heaven in todays rushed life.a must visit if you are looking for a quite relaxed time and some pampering
178,50,"Excellent Resort, really it takes you  near to natural beauty which can help you in getting refueled. Perfect destination which i will recommend to all . Food is too Tasty and will surely hit your taste-buds. Will surely visit here again .Pool area and Spa is at its best , but it needs to be updated as looks older at specially Spa . Staff was good and courteous."
179,20,"I remember this property from many years back. I had very high expectations when I visited them for a company program. Right from the word go the property looked tired, old and musty and a visit to the lobby level washrooms further validate the signs of total disarray. The toilets were totally stinking with no locks on the door, The food was OK at par with Dhabha food and finally a visit to the room further gave the impression of a lackadaisical management . The rooms had a strange musty smell and the toilets were just not clean as one would expect in a property like this."
180,50,it is one of the best  hotel and spa in karnataka i visited this place 3 tomes and finall i riveted just Assamese its quality behavior aswome u just visit and see you are requested to visit this place and see
181,30,"Golden Palms is surely one of the best resorts around Bangalore in terms of its architecture and space,lavish and beautiful green lawns, huge swimming pool and well maintained spacious rooms.  However the food is very average and not at all worth the cost.We decided to have dinner at the Poolside Restaurant named 'Badshah' which boasts of serving authentic Awadhi Cuisine.The Menu looked very enticing and we decided to go for some Awadhi Kebabs-.The waiter came back after 5 minutes informed that this particular dish is not available and we could go for Mutton Boti Kebabs.We agreed and asked him to go ahead and get the same. The Kebabs served were made out of stale meat,tasteless and were hard to be chewed upon. When i complained to the waiter,rather than accepting the mistake,he…"
182,10,"We had stayed in this resort for 2 nights in a deluxe suite room. You need to pay money only for the room and ambience.  They charge ₹1300 for a lunch/ dinner buffet and the food they serve is a STALE food.  The bar tender near the swimming pool has lots of ATTITUDE. After telling the names of person who booked the room he rejected to serve drinks. When asked for manager he said he himself is the manager.   When asked about the food, there staff said you need to eat what ever is served (whether it's stale food or what ever). After paying a hectic amount, want to have stale food it's a must visit place."
183,40,"It was a day outing with my team mates so this review doesn't include stay. The overall hotel is beautifully build ,exceptional architecture everywhere. The food is very good , we had breakfast and lunch. The breakfast spread was huge and lot of varieties which caters to Indian and foreign taste buds. The best part is the swimming pool which is a huge huge place. The swimming pool is divided into many areas with water polo , volley etc.   All in all its worth all the money you pay."
184,50,"I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights during a Medical Conference. The area is simply huge with ample greenery and lot of option for outdoor activities including a lovely swimming pool. Food was great, as was the service. Loved my stay here and would surely love to visit again."
185,30,"Bit outdated interiors but functionality ok rooms , satisfactory, tasty food but not pleasant restaurant. Since this hotel is about 18 km on outskirts to the main city. Very spacious hotel with good car parking facility. Good back lawns with palm trees around."
186,40,"I have been here for 4 days, during an official visit to Bengaluru. The place is good.. It's a wide spread resort and they have good facilities for sports and recreational purposes, they have an amazing pool and and a bar on the side of the pool,  night experience is good..  It will perfectly suite for a team outing purposes.. I have seen a wedding happening in during the same period when I was staying... Staff are good...  "
187,40,"This place is great for team outings out of Bangalore. The ambience is wonderful with lush greenery and huge pool. They have a nice 800m loop for jogging/running which is shaded by large trees. The pool area is really big. They have tennis and squash courts. They have indoor games like ping pong and carrom board. The breakfast, lunch and dinner spread was very good and extensive. The rooms and bathrooms are spacious and clean but dated. Service is very slow. Beverages like tea and coffee need improvement."
188,50,"This is truly a 5-star resort with ample space with lot of greenery, living up to its investor's dream.  Peacefully placed in the serene outskirts of Bangalore.  Stay is comfortable with large swimming pool and multiple restaurants inside the resort.  Decent place for family vacation and gathering."
189,30,We have finalized the company's annual day event (with an overnight stay) at this place. We were around 50 adults with 10 kids.   Property - Its a huge property and well placed rooms. But all are ageing as it is very old. You can see the rooms show the age. Otherwise decent rooms with ample space. Good option for large groups  Facilities - Facilities are good with lot of options to do as a team and as individual. Good place to have team activities with good privacy and own space. Team thoroughly enjoyed  Service - I feel their service can improve a bit as our evening tea was very cold when team was little late and they did not bother to serve it hot. Once prepared they just left it like that.  Also their planning can improve a bit as there was no once to carry our bags to rooms…
190,20,"This used to be an awe-inspiring destination. The view of the pool and the sprawling lawns lined by the cottages present a dream like reality. However, maintenance has certainly taken a hit as has the food and service. One can only wish they really do some introspection. The insipid welcome drink served gives away the lack of will to really be hospitable to the guests!"
191,50,I went there few months ago and i have taken Spa services there. After Spa i feel very relax and calm. i suggest to everyone to go there and try Spa services to feel relax. i feel it releases my stress and relax my body too.
192,30,"Sprawling buildings spread over around 20 acres of lush greenery.  Lovely pathways and spacious rooms.  Many conference spaces.  Outstanding banquet service by Rudresh and team.  Good food and courteous room service.   Unfortunately, all these positives were diminished and the overall experience made uncomfortable by a few glaring negatives:  1.  In spite of clearly communicating our requirements well in advance, and getting definite assurances from a smooth talking Sales person, the banquet hall was filthy.  The carpet folded up in places, split in the centre, and stained with spill overs.  The mattresses and bolsters that we had asked for were also cheap and lumpy, torn and stained, and most of them had no covers.  Thanks to Samsul, after much tension and wastage of time, we…"
193,40,Went there to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Overall a decent stay though property has started showing signs of ageing. Staff are commendable serve with a smile. Breakfast was decent and overall experience was satisfactory. 
194,40,"Rooms & stay was very good. Enjoyed. Within bengaloru but away from home, felt very enjoyable & good place for relax, get rid of tention from all day workload. Food right from breakfast to dinner, you can have your choice & taste."
195,30,"Let me start off by saying that I fell in love with the architecture and the place. Beautiful is not the word.  But old is not gold for this hotel.  Upkeep,  maintenance,  Bed Linen Quality,  Frayed Linen and Towels,  I complete room accessories.  Do I need to say more?  Why do they let such places go bad when they put such efforts to create beauty I wonder.  And if you would train your staff,  we would still forgive you but even they are not informed.  So book it in bulk for a wedding but please do not go alone. Not worth it!!! "
196,30,"This place is always crowded with corporate folks. Though we stayed here on a Wednesday and requested for a room away from the noise, they provided a room near aquabar where they had put loud music. They were not ready to provide us a different room.  They also do not provide high tea & snacks for package with AP plan which is really a surprise.  Our room was located near STP and there was a foul smell outside the room.  On the positive side, food spread and taste is very good in cafe solaire and staff are very helpful.  Property is also quite huge with lot of greenery and we enjoyed our many walks."
197,40,Golden Palms Hotel and Spa is at a comfortable distance from M G Road and is famous enough to get directions to reach the place.  It is a well-planned property with aesthetics and comfort built into the landscaping.  It boasts of the largest pool in Bengaluru. Food at the restaurant is excellent.  Rooms are comfortable with all the amenities that have now become regulars at any hotel.  We found service in the restaurants a bit erratic.  Remember to carry balls or floats for the children to use in the pool.
198,20,"Visited yesterday. Not at all satisfied  Staff is very poor, dont cooperate at all. No courtesy for tge guests. Not enough customozations for food and food options are very limited.  Not a good place for corporate events. "
199,30,"...that need a lot of renovation. Someone is not taking care of this really big and iconoc hotel.   Food is ok, but staff tried to fool us on the tab for drinks. This is really really bad when coming as a company the enjoy ourselves after a tough year. "
200,30,"Visited for work group function 8 nights, location is out side CBD and it's not noisy and better air qualities.  Airport is around 1.5 hours by taxi. Staff is friendly and helpful, and we secured a good deal room and food package including conference room. Now the average rating is considering India standard and price we paid half city rate per night including all meals, love the Indian food, they have Chinese won't recommend. Rooms are below average motel like, bedding and pillow are really old would do with a change. Overall upkeep is bad and lack investment as you see missing tiles in pool, bed room door not easy to open, many colleagues was locked out of room keycard issue. Everything look nice from a distance don't look close.  With that aside we enjoy the experience and…"
201,30,"The hotel is actually beautiful but the maintenance is not up to the mark.  Rooms are nice but maybe a bit overpriced.  But if you are going there for weekends its really good, only if you are a bangalorean, since the hotel is located on the outskirts of Bangalore there is not much pollution. Gym is nice. Spa is nice too.  Overall maybe a 3.5/5"
202,30,"We were put up in this property for a Customer Meet, we were welcomed by the Management team and the check in process was swift and smooth, but I am sure it went smooth because the rooms were already allotted before hand the the same was being handled by the our supplier who's Customer meet we were attending.   Upon going to the room from the lobby somewhere around 12 Noon, we noticed that the housekeeping of the hotel is in really pathetic condition, there were soiled plates lying outside almost all the rooms and the same seemed to have been there for almost a night and still the they were there even though it was noon, the building seems too old and there are patches where the paint has completely come off showing the age of the property, entering the room, we noticed that…"
203,30,"One used to hear a lot about this 'iconic' hotel. Unfortunately it has now lost some of its lustre. Gives the impression of a once beautiful property which is currently down on maintenance. Stingy housekeeping staff to say the least. We were booked in a triple room which was laid out for 2. No sign of the extra bed till after 7 pm. When asked for a towel the housekeeping peeps into the bathroom and says but you have 2 already. Shocking behaviour for a '7-star'. Breakfast was inedible - and I am not a picky eater by any standard. The so-called baked items were rubbery with some green goo teased onto them. Everything at the buffet was stone cold and when asked about it the staff replied it was because of the A/c. Sorry, but I have eaten every other breakfast buffet in the a/c as…"
204,50,"Beautiful well maintained property near Bengalore. Its a big resort with huge well maintained swimming pool in the middle surrounded by spacious villas. Each villa has verandah facing the garden & pool. Beautiful landscape & spacious dining rooms & poolside restaurent.   The best part was their customer service. I forgot pair of clothes. They promptly couriered to another city very next day!!  Overall one of the best resorts with excellent customer service, beautiful landscape & spacious amenities.   Highly recommend. 😊"
205,40,"Went for office function and liked the food, ambience, pool, environment...almost everything...Nice place just in the outskirts of Bangalore...Liked all the dishes served in the buffet lunch and dinner served beside the pool...will like to visit again!"
206,40,"The property is huge and well maintained however the rooms seemed old. Good food, neat, pool side bar and very courteous staff. The swimming pool is huge and tidy.   Overall, a good place to be while on a vacation."
207,40,"A well spent Sunday!!   Sangeetha the sales director was easy to work along with and ensured that all the arrangements for my team had been done and assured everything would be in place as suggested.  Sunday, the day of the outing. I was promptly being called and followed by Mr.Mohanty who was handling the F&B and ensured were the breakfast was being hosted for our group, he was also very prompt on addressing about the timings and the flexibility.  Everything was well charted out for us and the food was generous and very tasty, I don' t think there was anything that was a let down. The teams enjoyed their day. The only let down (and I am being nit-picky) is the desert which was not up to the mark.  The pool is an USP and the teams had lot of fun, the only other disappointment…"
208,50,"I heard from one of my friends. Golden Palm , Hotel & spa is Providing best service. I suggest you to miss the service. The Service is Awesome.I'm Planning to visit once in every Month. Visit once you can feel the best Service"
209,40,"The Hotel is very spacious and peaceful. The check-in part was not so great... as it took more than an hour to check-in despite of requesting it for 12:00 Noon... Even no Welcome drink has been offered and the room is far away and no cart was provided so it's a tough walk mid-noon from reception to the room with a toddler.   Other than check-in part rest of the day stay was great.. only problem is every facility in hotel is bit far and it would be very difficult move around without cart (battery car), especially for parents with toddlers / infants. or elderly people  WiFI i snot working... Food is Great... Staff are courteous...  Check-out portion is smooth.."
210,30,During our recent family get together we experience that this is very nice property well spread over to a large area. Rooms were good and specious. The biggest issue is that poor service and thus may be effecting the customer service greatly. They must improve their service to turn this property a great place to unwind. Food spread is also good.
211,40,"We visited this place in MARCH 2016 as a part of team Quarterly. It bit far from the city but worth it that much traveling as it has the best facilities for both indoor and outdoor sports.  Some of our teammates who were not in mood to play cricket under burning sun, enjoyed indoor games like,  1) Badminton 2) Lawn tennis 3) Table Tennis 4) Chess 5) Foosball While bunch of us enjoyed a cricket in outdoor. After Cricket we had lunch, lunch was great. We hit swimming pool after lunch and never wanted to come out. But it was time that pulled us out for returning from the Golden palm resort. Before leaving they had arranged 2 snacks and Tea/Coffee for us.  IT WAS GREAT PLACE TO VISIT AGAIN n AGAIN.  By the way it was 3rd visit in a 2 years from same team. Thanks for arranging such a…"
212,40,"I had been to this place yesterday for a team outing with office colleagues. We started with Water polo and pool volleyball. The bar here on the pool side is very expensive. The  food buffet was tasty with a good spread. One can also play volleyball, badminton, cricket for team activity."
213,30,"Nice greenery just outside the city. This place is mostly well-maintained. I enjoyed walking around the property. Main downsides were some old, run-down furniture in the room and moss on the sides of the (otherwise great!) swimming pool.  The Italian restaurant is a joke. There was no other customer there when we went and there were at least six staff members, yet it took them nearly 10 minutes to get us the menu. A single copy of the menu for a group of three. The food itself was very Indianized, and setting the bill took about 15 minutes.  Most people just go to the buffet place and there is neither the place not the staff to handle the crowd.

214,50,Words are less to describe this resort. The entrance is Royal. When you are lifted in the golf cars from  the reception and taken to your rooms you and on reaching your rooms you feel you are pampered in true sense. Food is the speciality here. Shall visit again some time in future. 
215,10,"I attended a two day conference at this terrible resort. 1) Staff was inadequate for such a large resort. 2) Whatever staff they have have no sense of respect for their customers. Rude, incompetent, incapable, idiots of highest order including their managers who worse than the staff working under them. 3) Food is pathetic 4) I ordered room service. It took them 1 hour to serve the food. Domino's delivers pizza in 30 mins. 5) I had a presidential suite at this property. Ideally, they should reserve a cart for their guest staying at presidential suite but leave that aside, I kept calling the reception for it but they did not send it and I had to go to the reception personally to call a cart to get my luggage from my room while checking out.  Would not recommend this property for…"
216,40,"Stayed there for a 2 nights. Food was good. Rooms were large size and well decorated. Bathroom was nice with jacuzzi. Quiet and peaceful. Though far from the city. Not much activity to do, but relax. Pool is large and clean. Will have to walk good distance from room to reception if your room is far... Didn't mind the walk though. Tried calling buggy many times... but did not turn up ... So had to carry my hand luggage all the way at check out. Overall a good experience."
217,30,"I stayed here for one night and it was OK.  Checkin process took longer due to the crowd. We were given a room near to the reception and it was good. As the club house, kids play area & few restaurants are near by.  The restaurant near the pool is crowded especially during the lunch (buffet - Sunday brunch) and very poorly managed. There are no proper tables to have lunch and no booking/reservation system. And Sunday brunch costs around Rs. 1250 plus taxes.  We had a very good time in pool with my kid. Pool is very well maintained with all the changing & shower rooms. Swimming attire is also available for sale.  Lawns are very well maintained.  Food menu is too pricey."
218,20,I visited the resort with family on September 5th for a day outing and the experience was not that good. Right from the car parking the staff were not attentive. No staff bothered to pay attention to us. There was no welcome greetings. The reception staff were not at all pleasant and didn't even bother to say a good morning. Buffet breakfast and lunch were just ok nothing great. But the terrible staff never came to us and offered any help. We had to ask for each and everything we wanted. The swimming pool was really big and good. We enjoyed there. We paid extra Rs. 200 + tax per hr for cycle and enjoyed that as well.  There were indoor and outdoor games as well. The property looks appealing overall but can't comment on the rooms since it was a day out package and didn't take a…
219,50,"Stayed at this property for a well needed time-off and was truly memorable. Each and every facility of this property was well maintained. Right from check-in till check-out was smooth. Staff, food and ambiance are too good. I have been to this property for several day-outs in the past and each time they have improved a lot in each and every department. Thank you team."
220,30,The hotel had an attractive ambiance and the staff were quite friendly. The overall maintenance was bad . The food was average . This place is good for a night stay. The pool is a great place to play and have fun!!! The maintenance has to be given attention to at as it is quite an old resort.
221,10,İ am traveling all over the world because of my biz i stayed lots of hotel i can stay any of again but not here only ambiance is good other things is terrible foods not good rooms is not cleaning perfectly not changing towels daily and they are not checking mini bar very far from city and find taxi is not easy 
222,40,"We had a two night- three days stay at the hotel with my family and friends. After celebrating the birthday one day prior , we had a great wonder stay with lot of enjoyment and great food.   The Cafe Solaire buffet had always been my family great choice with lots of varieties and awesome food.On Sunday we had the best of the Brunch with lots of fun and activities. It was a long course of food , food and food with unlimited soft beverage and beer.The Resort was completely gave a experience of being in fare with so many people and the resort was managing very well meeting people across and taking care personally.

Staff is very rude and doesn't seem to care about guest, no courtesy in informing guest before closing buffet... I have seen people waiting  for food and useless staff just don't care... I felt like I never had food in last two days and finally I had to pay in Badshah Restaurent and get some quality food and it was very good.seems like complimentary food provided by hotel is of lowest standards and seems like intentionally they are keeping low standards. Overall I never found staff to be caring and seems like they are enjoying reputation as corporate customers make a bee line to arrange their workshops. I planned to arrange 3 more workshops for my team but…"
225,30,"I stayed for one night as part of a corporate conference. It is well located about 40 minutes out of central Bangalore - once you are there its hard to believe you are that close to a major city - its a quiet and tranquil spot.  The rooms are perfectly adequately appointed and the balconies on the upper floor rooms are large and offer a great perspective of the gardens and pool. I really enjoyed the large shower and the water flow was strong and hot. Very nice.  Room maintenance however was lacking so it looked and felt a little shabby. The gardens are very nice (but watch out for falling coconuts) and, although I did not try the pool, it was a very inviting central feature. Breakfast at the poolside was a nice way to start the day and I thought the food was ok - a little…"
226,10,While i am staying writing this review to my friends...please don't stay and loose your money and comfort.morning breakfast area the staff is very rude.very bad attitude.morning ordered for a coffee and first time there is some brown color particle in it and asked to replace the milk and again they bringing the milk and same problem.its very funny and my personal plea is please don't stay and loose your temper
227,30,"We were on a official outing in a week day. The breakfast was up to the mark. The behavior of staff was rude and no courtesy. The lunch was terrible and not sure how they got a 4 star resort accreditation. The Sports facilities was having variety, but no quality equipment."
228,30,"Rooms felt old and could observe cracks, leakages, sqeaky/shaky doors. Service is slow - we asked twice for napkins in our room and we got paper towels instead of Turkish napkins.  The food buffet varieties and food quality was only average. Food again seemed quite overpriced for the quality.  Pool is really huge and have 2-3-4 ft depths. Spa is great. Room layout is really good with the rooms on the top floor having a big balcony facing the pool. Checkin/out experience was quick and hassle free.  Overall, it felt overpriced for the money paid."
229,50,"Had been to this place for team day out, we thoroughly enjoyed activities at the resort with people mostly engaged with pool games and buffet lunch. Spread was superb with mix of Indian and continental cuisines well complimented by live counters. Room charges are slightly on higher side but the overall experience makes it worthwhile."
230,40,"This one is more known for its ancestral lineage of ownership to Mr. Sanjay Khan of course the event of his son's wedding! So it's been a while since that event and the ownership has changed hands.   Let's get into the criticism right away shall we?  Rating 1 to 5 with 5 being the highest.  Ambiance: 3 - So the fact is that the glory days are gone and this is very evident. There are more than a few cracks visible(literally) and the splendour or opulence that this property may have had in its hay days is lost. Still remains massively impressive in a few counts, one the size of the pool GIGANTIC! The property spans over quite a few acres so it's visually very appealing in the evening with the lights on (most of the eye sores are hidden)  Rooms: 3 - Tired rooms, has had some…"
231,10,"Went there for a day out on our Anniversary. Their pool staff is horribly rude. I immediately called up the manager to cancel my booking since I just got in there and haven't used any of the facilities. He gave me sweet talks etc but our day were ruined so asked him cancel and refund my money. He promised to take care of it but I never got any refund. Needless to say, I've filed charge back on my credit card. They need to train their staffs. At least teach them to behave and not to stare at ladies like rapist."
232,40,"Golden Palms Hotel & Spa is a very nice Hotel to stay...!!!  Hotel Rooms are spacious with Balcony...!!! Swimming Pool is huge....!!! One of the biggest I have seen in any Hotel.  They also have good facilities for recreational activities...like Tennis Court, Open Badminton court, Snooker and Pool, Squash, TT and few other Indoor Games...!!!  Food Quality is good. They have a very big property...!!!  Overall a good experience of Stay in this Hotel."
233,40,"A nice  place to spend cosy time. I went to have a 2 days business conference . The place was very crowded with EY corporate meetings etc.  Lunch was very good with lot if options.the resort is owned by a celebrity Sanjay Khan in past due to that his choice of selections reflect every where be on wall painting or Sculpture. Good fountain every where. Pool side is best in class, room are cozy but need mosquito repellent  due to greenery. The  jogging track is a great place to walk.  The buffet spread certainly nowhere near a five star spread. Overall good stay"
234,40,I went there for a corporate offsite with colleagues. Its a luxury hotel with a spacious outdoor swimming pool. The food quality was great. Its rated as a 4.5 Star hotel in most of the websites; few rated it as 5 Star also. The service quality was of good standard. We had a musical programme inside one of the restaurants which offered quality food options. It is located in a peaceful locality away from the hustle bustle of the city. Overall a nice place for business meets and group offsites.
235,40,"Great place to spend quiet and cosy time. We went to have a romantic weekend to celebrate wife's birthday. The place was very crowded with several corporate meetings etc. Italian restaurant was not available and the Chinese one was not looking impressive. Lunch was very good but dinner was bad.   All is not hunky dory as is believed just because the resort is owned by a celebrity. There are areas of improvement to bring the rating up to its formerly five star status. Right now it hovers near a four star, mainly staff centric. Entirely a personal observation and opinion. Most of them have poor knowledge and comprehension of English as we experienced at the restaurant, reception, billing, and spa. There is no sense of urgency in attending to customer needs, giving the impression…"

The ambience still remains awesome; landscaping captivating but noticed several shortcuts in quality of service, since we last visited a decade back. The check-in and check-out was inordinately delayed.  The staff at the reception have poor knowledge and comprehension of English.   Billing was messed up and had to be pointed out and redone.  Food was another big disappointment in Cafe Solaire, the twenty four hour coffee shop.  We had three meals, a lunch a la carte of grilled fish and fish fry the only dish that was to our taste.  For dinner we ordered spaghetti with minced pork.  Not only was the spaghetti undercooked but the spices were overpowering as a consequence.  Olive oil…"
238,50,I had gone there for business purpose. I have found a great hotel for leisure. Hotel has a great spa. Gardening of this hotel is awesome. Hotel has a very huge Swimming pool. Specially Indian Food which I had there was so tasty.
239,10,"Checked in with family for 3 nights and the less I say is better considering there isn't much good to say barring the spa. Terrible service, poor customer service and an overall bad experience( really sad considering we are members too). I do hope you all will improve considering it's a beautiful property. The only highlight of our trip was the spa which is truly world class. Regards, Rohan Chinniah- 207"
240,30,"We had a mixed experience at the Golden Palms. Though the property is beautiful, with lush green plans there is no body who would keep you engaged. Staffs are not so friendly, So many restrictions and Poor options for amusement. Only part to be appreciated here is the food spread. For all breakfast lunch and dinner there were plenty of options."
241,40,"This is a well spread out resort, located little far from city. The rooms are nicely done, giving more like cottage rooms feel. There is balcony/spatio opeing into gardens.. They have the nicest and largest pool. The overall ambience is also nice."
242,10,"MY EMAIL TO RESORT MANAGEMENT :  We had booked 3 rooms in Golden Palms resort – Bangalore on 11th June '16.  My feedback is, we are extremely unhappy with the service. Worst service ever !  Spoke to Ajay (Lobby Manager) & expressed our displeasure about the service. As I told him about uploading pictures and feedback on Trip Advisor & other websites. Ajay requested not to do so & give you a chance to look in to it. So I waited for one week to see if I will at least get a call from their team regarding my feedback, surprisingly didn’t get that as well.   Areas of displeasure / concerns (Feedback picture attached) 1.	Swimming pool – Lot of people including kids were using the pool. But seems like your management never gets it cleaned. It’s very dirty with algae stuck on the pool…"
243,50,"The rooms were excellent, the food was lovely & the service was amazing. Hats off to the management as every detail was looked into & taken care. Had been there in 2013 & 2015 on a business visit & personal visit. Nice to relax & great location advantage for those coming into bangalore. Would definitely recommend to family members & friends."

246,20,"I had a very mixed experience at the Golden Palms.. Though the property is beautiful, with lush green plantations and nice landscaping everywhere which gives you a nice feeling, the amnesties were not that great. Be ready to shell out a bomb on food and drinks if you are ordering from in house restaurants, as that's the only option. A bottle of  Bisleri mineral water costs Rs.174(original MRP Rs 20) and a 500 ml bottle of Pepsi costs Rs 208. surprised? Yes thats how they are looting the customers as they have to be dependent on in house food and beverages.

After much altercation he reluctantly agreed as if they were…"
247,30,"We visited Golden Palms hotel and spa  for a quiet peaceful getaway. Had heard a lot about the place and were looking forward to a nice relaxing holiday. Unfortunately, though the place was quite a disappointment in terms of the service and amenities provided. Rooms though large and airy, were not well maintained. Bathrooms were stained and run down. Basics such as toothpaste and toothbrushes were not provided. When requested for, we were provided with one toothbrush despite the room being a double occupancy room. Again the room was provided with just one towel. There was not even a floor towel in the bathroom to allow the floor to stay dry. The room service menu had a very limited selection and did not list all of the restaurants. Room service was also extremely slow and…"
248,40,"Wow !! That's all I would say. One of the best I have ever been. Rooms are clean and maintained well. It got a quite big lawns where you will love to spend your evenings. Even a small walk with your loved ones will make you feel good. Check in was good as there were many helping hands. There was bit of rush due to some meetings there. But night was quiet.  Didn't had chance to try the lunch, but overall the food was pretty good than I expected. Hotel staff was very helpful in setting up a candle light dinner in the sit out, which was just awesome. Tenderloin chicken in red wine sauce, give it a shot.  Staff in the restaurant have to be a bit more polite. But not all of them, just a few. I don't have much to say. It was worth the money I spend. The location is bit off the limit…"
249,40,"Golden Palms is totally geared for the group/event hotel. Very few individual travellers most are part of a corporate group. The hotel is showing its age and lack of maintenance. The walls of the beautiful pool are covered in algae, room service is at a snail's pace. The food in the buffet is tasty but the crowds and few waiters clearing the tables take away one's appetite. Early on a Saturday morning (8am) a sound check for the next corporate event is carried out with will little regard for sleeping patrons, overall in review I give it a thumbs down with no plans to return."
250,50,"I visited this place with my family and had a great time. There are indoor and outdoor sports to be enjoyed. We have a huge swimming pool here which is worth spending time. There's a poolside restaurant, indoor restaurant, outdoor restaurant and what not. It is one of the best resorts I have been to in Bangalore. If you are planning to visit the place, then do keep some time for swimming pool, its worth it. The quality of the food is also very good. Its got a very big garden space, my daughter played a lot there, and also in the children play area. Overall, its worth every penny spent."
251,50,"So, about a 100 of us descended onto this property for a team meet. Check in was pretty smooth but the time 12pm time sense is little bit cozy. Rooms are quite a walk from the lobby with a buggy on call for those needing help. Rooms are a bit dated but have a warm and comfy ambient. I heard the biggest pool after seeing the pool it tremendous, massive and well maintained. Only cons is the outer area of Bangalore and check in time"
252,40,"Stayed in 2014 for 4 nights on official trip. Lush green property, with large rooms, facing garden. good for family to stay and relax. Food spread was awesome from north indian to continental, south indian specialities, like curd rice, bisibilli baht etc are still to be cherished. Hospitality at its best. Clean swimming pool with bar is an option to hangout."
253,50,"Been there with family, excellent and great experience. Rooms are huge with nice open balcony with sitout. foods are excellent, spread nicely with varities and tastes. Great experience overall...slightly on higher costs for 2 days should have some nice package or similar things offered will be great!"

255,40,"This is an amazing property in the outskirts of Bangalore. Food spread is great. outdoor and indoor games are good. The best part is the swimming pool and the pool games. The villas have rooms which are spacious and state of art. It also had conference room etc. Spa is said to be bangalores best. Only hitch is the price, which is quite high."
256,40,I had gone on a day out with my family and the resort is well located and very big lot of greenery around the coffee shop served us very good buffet lunch and  the spread was great the swimming pool was huge and my kid really enjoyed a lot overall a good place for day outing

The lawns are big with lush green grass and coconut trees all around.   The rooms are quite spacious too with all luxury amenities as expected.A prompt service made the stay enjoyable.  The swimming pool is massive with dedicated section for kids which is barricaded for their safety.   The food layout was elaborate as well as appealing to the eyes. The taste was a little bit let-down, as it had a heavy south-Indian influence.   The spa service was the icing on the cake.Nothing beats a relaxing spa in such a location.  Personal recommendation- Choose the rooms in the ground floor. You would hate the climb after the…"
258,20,Stayed here for a corporate event. This was my 2nd stay. Trust other than looks the property does not have anything good to offer. Lets go one by one. The rooms did not have Towels. Even after calling they take more than 30 minutes to come with it which is a old towel. Cannot tell you such a bad condition. The mattress will be lying at the entrance of each unit. they just look shabby and does not give you a feel of 5 star property. Room Service takes more than 45 minutes to send Tea. It arrives after the guests have gone.   Banquet area is just not to the expectation. The wash rooms are not cleaned for ages. The Banquet gives a bad smell. Had to tell them to get a air freshner. Carpet is come out from various places. Absolutely no services. Had to call the GM atleast 5 times to…
259,40,"The hotel is actually nice with greenery surrounding all rooms and huge swimming pool. However, it can improve a lot in terms of customer service. The staffs at the hotel were not that friendly. We lost our bag during check out but no one was willing to help us. Also, the breakfast is too repetitive and we got bored of eating the same thing for a week. "
260,40,"A well-known resort in bangalore, Golden Palm largely lived up to our expectations during our weekend trip.   Humungous swimming pool, sprawling and well- maintained property, loads of greenery and a mouth watering variety of food makes your stay enjoyable.    Only issues are - 1. Slow room service for in-house guests. Unfortunately our room had an issue with the magnet in the main lock. 2 times we were locked out of our room, 2nd time at night after the swim we were kept waiting for almost 15 minutes outside our room, before someone came to our rescue (a not so great sight/feeling, coz we were dripping wet and famished in our respective swimming costumes waiting in the lobby). On the 2nd night when I wanted to use the fridge to store the left over cake, I realised the fridge is…"
261,30,"We stayed at Golden Palm for a day during our wedding anniversary. The resort is well maintained and full of greenery. They had a huge swimming pool for all age groups; kids would enjoy it during summers.  Though the ambience is average, the food is excellent at the Cafe Solaire -  a multicuisine cafe and staff there are very friendly. They have 3 restaurants - Chinese, Italian and Indian. However, we couldn't try any of the three as one of them was closed down due to rain and the other two were allocated to corporates. One complaint that I would always have is they are so focused on catering to the corporates that the retail customer is ignored.  We tried their spa ""Eva"" and we found it very average. Very expensive for the service they offer. There are much better spas in…"
262,30,"For sure the property has seen it's best times & is well past it's prime.  On positive side, their are vast spaces of greenery & the surroundings are peaceful & serene. Rooms are specious.   On the negative side : Staff service is pretty ordinary, breakfast average."
263,50,"I stayed at Golden Palms Hotel and Spa for 1N/2D as part of a business meet of our company. The hotel is not very far from the airport in terms of distance but the traffic of Bengaluru city makes it a 90 minute journey. The hotel is located at a nice,  silent place which is a plus point. Once you are in this hotel, you don’t need to go anywhere else as you can definitely spend a couple of days relaxing here and enjoying the property. We were allotted rooms within minutes of checking in and they upgraded us to a suite without us asking them for it. The whole place is very green with lots of coconut trees everywhere. You can see people felling coconut from these trees and catching them in a bag. The way to rooms from the main lobby is nice and it feels that you are traveling…"
264,50,"The rooms are good and the food is great. Chef Francis, Mr. Sandeep and Ms. Arenla and Ms. Kajal and the rest of the team are fantastic hosts.  They made sure everything went smoothly and were always on premises through out the event for any help/ service."
265,40,"Beautiful rooms, nice spread, midst of nature (as created), AMAZING LIGHTING in the night, a Spa, a Huge pool, a sports facility - what more do you want when you'd like to party with your friends and family.  They sport a huge buffet restaurant, though I will admit at times, it felt really far away and at the other end. Loved the place, the cleanliness, and also the staff who were really friendly.   Cheers"
266,40,"The place is so beautiful and relaxing. But the food is horrible. I have attended recently 2 functions at this place but the food was less than good.  Why so... don't know who can answer. Even when I checked some of the ingredients of the dishes what they are making ready then and there, but to my surprise they were not up to the mark. Any way I thought this is not a small thing. When you are going to such a place .... you don't expect such food."
267,50,"Visited after a gap of five years and hosted a event for 180 people. The resort hotel still is full of greenery, the staff very cordial , food is still good . Rooms are also in good shape and did not receive any complaint from any guest. Check in , check outs were all smooth. The pool is beautiful and large , even for non swimmer it is a visual treat. Enjoyed every minute of the stay. Congratulations to the entire team."
268,50,"A very good place to spend a weekend away from Bangalore. The place is very well kept. The pool was gorgeous, large and clean. The pool has 3 areas, 5ft, 4ft, and 2ft deep. Total pool area almost seemed like 10000 Sqft !! My kids aged 12, 8 & 5 had a blast in the pool. The greenery is very well maintained. The trees and plants are healthy and happy. The stroll in the garden is really refreshing.  They have a few restaurants but one by the pool side is what is open for square meal. Rest seem like a la carte and not attended. But the food  at the pool side restaurant was great. They even have a well run pool side bar.  They do offer pool (aka billiards) , squash, table tennis, carom board etc. For squash you need sport shoes. Kids below 15 not allowed on pool table.  Overall great…"
269,40,Had stayed for a night and spent 2 days as part of a leadership outing. Stay was awesome; the pool was the best and so huge. Green and clean place. Enjoyed every minute and highly recommended. Had seen many families having good time. Bit far to reach but worth a travel.
270,50,"It was a golden chance on behalf of me to go to Golden palm resort, Bangalore. simply WOW expertise. The resort is well maintained and a perfect place for an oversized cluster, or a gaggle of families to pay some leisure. The food quality was sensible. The gardens and plantations ar very good. The swimming bath is one amongst the most important of its kind I actually have ever seen until date at any resort."
271,40,"I was here on a business trip wherein we had a team building event and the place was a perfect one for the event. Completely away from the city traffic, pollution, lots of open spaces, swimming pool, facilities for both indoor & outdoor games, conference rooms, auditoriums and the most important one - a really sumptuous food. Additionally, the place is very neat & clean and well maintained. for sports related activities (indoor & outdoor) they would be providing all the amenities.the food is a buffet and its really good which comprises of Indian, western, desserts etc."
272,40,Getting there took some time but once in the resort it was calm. The staff is great and always ready to help. Food is Ok. The star attraction is for sure the Big pool which can host multiple groups at same time. Lot of corporate events take place here so days esp evening may be a bit noisy due to music.  Spa here is great but you need to take a prior appointment to get ur preferred slot.
273,30,"The place looks dry, nothing much to the hype that it has got. Apart from the huge swimming pool, nothing else worth mentioning. even the pool had lot of fungus on the side walls. Food was pathetic and nothing was tasty. I went there for a corporate event."
274,40,"It was a golden opportunity for me to visit Golden palm resort, Bangalore. Just WOW experience. The resort is well maintained and an ideal place for a large group, or a group of families to spend some leisure time. The food quality was good. The gardens and plantations are superb. The swimming pool is one of the biggest of its kind I have ever seen till date at any resort. The driving distance from Bangalore airport is around of 1.5-2 Hours based on the traffic. I would really love to spend some time at this resort whenever I visit to bangalore again."
275,30,"I have been to Golden Palms twice - both for office offsite... I think they need to restrict this place for office offsite and very large groups ....  No doubt the resort is spacious, good etc .. i think the service here is poor .. rooms really needs renovation, the toilet linen needs some attention ... staff is also not very efficient ... I cannot stay here by paying from own pocket .. but for large groups and office groups .. nice place .. lots of open space and very large swimming pool.."
276,40,"Hosting a full day event for 150 people can be quite a hassle if not for the right venue and team. Golden Palms however gave us little reason to complain.  Located outside Bangalore, it is a very quiet location with nothing much around you. The resort is well spread out and has a massive swimming pool, restaurants, spa and gaming areas plus a really large conference hall. The rooms are spread out but a buggy is available for those who might not be fit enough to walk much.   We stayed at the suite, room number 164 and it was the kind of room that is difficult to expect within the city. Size of the hall and the bedroom were both very large, the bathroom had a tub and a separate dressing area. Overlooking the pool it was a nice room.  We hardly got to spend time in the room, but it…"

278,40,"I had visited last year for a day out and it was a good resort over all. It has a very good spa and the service is good. However food is not very good, you can say Average. Also the pool is very large and some of the areas really need facelift....."
279,40,"A very nice, traditional hotel calm oasis in mid bustling Bangalore.. with a gym, pool if exercise important and selection restaurants... but watch out for the potentially falling coconuts..!.. room good , spacious , air conditioning etc..  "
280,40,"We went to this resort in a group of 17 with family and friends on a bright sunny morning on a package of breakfast-lunch-buffet and activities for a day. The sumptuous breakfast varieties and multitude of options on lunch buffet swept our feet and we really enjoyed the wide varieties of appetizers, salads, main courses, soups, desserts in both veg and non-veg sections. I have never had such a lunch buffet before with continental, asian, authentic indian, european, russian, mexican, middle east dishes to savor. I had been in US and Singapore for more than 8 years and have tasted cuisines from many parts of the world but buffet here was amazing to speak the least. The swimming pools here are huge with crystal clear water, very spacious and ideal for fun activities with friends…"
281,20,"Stayed as part of office outing. It's located on the outskirts of Bangalore with nothing special about the location as such.  Hotel: It's a nice big sprawling property - big pool and lots of space for sports and amenities. It can use an overall facelift though - the buildings look a little tired and dirty. A coat of paint, some landscaping work etc are needed.  Food: The breakfast spread was good while not being extravagant. The dinner/lunch were also quite ok while not being out of the world.  Rooms: Big spacious rooms. However, the fixtures need an urgent update too. The switches are all discolored and seem flimsy. The bathroom fixtures are all faded, lost the layer of chrome and are loose and squeaky.  Overall - decent place for a stay away from the city but can be more…"
282,40,"The room was decent though, the swimming pool was a big one. Also enjoyed the sauna and steam rooms. Couldn't get a spa reservation as they were full on a Saturday. The breakfast was really nice with ample options of all types. Only bad experience was we were not provided room key. Overall, good."
283,50,"We cancelled Oberoi's booking to stay there for one more day. Though the rooms are made in an old way but they are spacious & well maintained. What I liked the most is their well maintained gardens, pathways & greenery. Being a nature lover I spent good time roaming amidst them."
284,50,I stayed in this place from 8th jan to 10 JAN 2016. We stayed in this place as part of our company meeting(merck). the place is good and well maintained. the rooms are good and well furnished. the food is also good. only area of improvement needed is room services.
285,20,"I have stayed here while participating in a convention in Bangalore convention center, this hotel has large number of rooms, large swimming pool, huge spa, vast garden areas etc., but it gets ZERO for the quality of service, starting from the bell desk to reception, restaurant to housekeeping everyone works with a don't care attitude here, it seems like they get good business from corporate companies and conventions so they don't really give a damn about service. During the weekends you can be assured of noisy pool parties and whole bunch of drunk people around the hotel.   Unless you are going for on a business trip with an easy access to the convention center there is no reason for you to choose this hotel, if you are looking for leisure you will be deeply disappointed!"
286,40,"We went in mid of 2015, and have stayed 2 nights and 3 nights. Start with the place, it is very spacious, for each and every foot you encounter a palm tree. Swimming pool at its best. Rooms have balconies and food is also good. Do visit this place for a short picnic with your family/friends."
287,40,"I had a chance to stay here in the month of November'15 for  a business trip.Having stayed in few good resorts earlier my expectations were high from Golden Palm. i must say it did meet my expectations.  Below is the brief from my stay; View from my balcony which happened to be on second floor was amazing mainly because the pool was clearly visible.Also the room quality was good and bathrooms were clean and tidy. Campus is big enough to keep you relaxed.I walked around the campus and found it to be around 700-800 mts in perimeter.There is ample greenery and the best part of the resort is its pool area.Though, I could not manage to swim in the pool. Food out here was just average whether it was Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner.I found the breakfast menu to be the same on all three days.…"
288,40,"The minute you enter this five star resort you feel like you are transported to another world. There is so much greenery around you that you feel like going for a walk or cycling around the property! The place is quite big. The reception has been tastefully decorated with a very regal ambience. The staff is friendly and the service is quite good. We were escorted to our room very quickly. The property is quite big and will take a good amount of walking to reach the room. The deluxe room was spacious and had really rich looking furniture. Everything matches with the decor. The room was really clean with a nice view from the balcony. Room service was also very quick! The bathroom was clean, and posh and had all necessary toiletries in place. There is an activities room where you…"

290,10,"I regrettably had my wedding at the Golden Palms in November 2015 and around 15 guests and I stayed at the resort for 3 nights. The entire stay was a nightmare from the minute we checked in until we left the “resort”  Just to list a few of the issues we faced: -The 1st night we checked into one of their high-end overpriced suits we had mud water pouring out of all the taps, the shower, the toilet and the bath  -We had around 5-6 room and most of the rooms did not have a working phone our entire stay  -The 1st night one of the my guests didn’t have a towel, or sheets or a pillow to sleep on and was unable to do anything about it as it was midnight when we checked in and she didn’t have a phone to call them about it  - Most of the rooms didn’t have a working fridge our entire…"

Considering the reputation of the resort, we didn’t expect any threat and since we were attending a wedding, the valuables were put in the locker.  What happened to us over there was horrifying. At 5:00, my mom to her surprise found the glass door open and so she got up to check, to her horror, she found that a man had entered her room and he was looking through her purse . Can you imagine that happening to you while you are sleeping ???? He saw her,she tried catching him and he pushed her and she hit the bed and shouted out in pain. I was sleeping in the cot next to the door and I got up and rushed for help. Now, coming to the…"
292,20,Decent place to host an offsite meeting in Bangalore. However it takes forever to get there. Absolutely don't recommend it because of the time you spend getting (and back out) to the resort. Simply not worth it. The food at the biggest is also below average. 
293,40,I've been here with office colleagues for a office family day event. What an amazing environment and very huge swimming pool with clear water. Even we can play volleyball in the swimming pool. Lot of coconut trees and well maintained all the places.  I really liked food and play areas. I would suggest this place for best day out/ stay during weekend relaxations.
294,40,The place stood tall for the reputation and mouth publicity. Property is excellent and one can only imagine such place far from Bangalore. With one of the biggest pools and scenic Restaurants it was a nice evening spent without any doubt. Baadshah restaurant owner and staff were good at their service and they arranged a surprised candle light dinner for our friend in such a short notice. Thanks to them !! I could have given the property 5 stars but the room service and quality of amenities available in a standard room was below accepted level. Balcony had a light which was not working and even after complaints it was not resolved.  I guess core service levels needs to be taken care of and the rest would be done by the location and ambiance of the property.
295,40,"Bangalore is a busy , busy busy city so this was a wonderful calm oasis in amoung to retreat to. With a established old colonial feel, choice of restaurants,  a spa and gym area to help pass those evenings after a busy busy day.. "
296,50,"We had a stay for Two night three days. We were Eight family friends like re-union after two years,  enjoyed the hospitality with so many many wonderful and memorizing experience. The lavish and mouthwatering buffet at the pool side restaurant and specially at night enjoying sizzling Kebabs from Badshah and Biryani by Chef Ajit with soothing light music. We have really enjoyed the stay with so refreshing green surrounding in coconut Groove. The swimming pool is a WOW factor and the resort is truly a re inviting one.  Really with a kind of life at Bangalore , Delhi, Mumbai & Chennai, we didn't thought about the paradise at Bangalore.Appreciate the People of resort because for sure they were very helpful.

297,50,"We came to Golden Palms Hotel to attend a wedding function. It was a WOW experience for us in terms of food & service.   The resort is nestled away from the hustle bustle of the traffic mess and has lush greenery to sooth the mind and body. The property is well maintained with spacious rooms and offers a beautiful view. The rooms have a wonderful balcony and also have a walk in area in the mornings.  The property gives a lot of options to stretch your muscles via swimming pool,table tennis table, squash court, badminton court, tennis court and a good gymnasium.   We were little skeptic before checking into the hotel as there was a review concerned with the safety & security of the hotel. But we were proved wrong, all the arrangements were in place & we were taken care very well.…"
298,50,"I came here for a family wedding. What an amazing experience. Lush green, well maintained, away from hustle and bustle of Bangaluru. Delicious foods. It's a huge property where one can take a long walk, swimming pool, enjoy spa and massage etc. Rooms could have been made bit more neater but still very good. Service of staff was equally praise worthy. I wish I had more time to spend. Lots of variety of foods especially South Indian foods. A great treat to me and family."
299,50,"Rooms - spacious and great ambiance Lobby- open and large facilities- resort away from the city, about 200 rooms so good for groups as well breakfast spread- good variety  they have two open grounds where family groups can indulge in cricket/football or any other feild game of their choice  overall a nice experience, good for a leisurely weekend."
300,40,"Recently I stayed at the property for 6 nights on official business. The ambience is just fantastic with a wonderful serene surrounding having coconut trees, pool,spa and everything you need for relaxation after a hectic days work. The jogging track is very well maintained and provided just the right start to the morning. Though the room service times can be improved but seeing the vast expanse, it is still understandable. Overall a great experience"
301,10,"We attended a family function on the 6th Dec. At about 0450hrs on 7th morning an intruder entered in my sister-in-laws room from the back door when she was sleeping. (Incidentally we subsequently learned that in most of the rooms, the latch on the backdoor are not working as also there are no CCTV cameras installed there). By chance my sister-in-law was waken up by the slightest of the noise created. She tried to nab the intruder,while shouting for help instantly. the intruder immediately attacked the victim & ran away from the back door The victim was hurt by the attack & started bleeding profusely. What started thereafter was a bigger nightmare. The hotel front desk did not respond to the frantic in-house telephone.I had to run for almost 100 mtrs to front desk & shout for…"
302,30,"We visited for a wedding and found Golden Palms to be a grand and versatile establishment but missing all of the finishing touches. Did not seem to have been renovated for quite some time, which was a shame considering its potential. Staff were mostly very helpful. "
303,40,"PROS: ====== - Spacious - Good hygienic rooms, though not so spacious (standard rooms) - Average food - Good pool side bar and party place - Changing room is good, Have clean towels to offer, Showers work - Good amenities and activities to do - Relaxing for night stay though expensive - Good landscaping - Can accommodate big groups - Good enough ground to play - V. Good spa. Many types of massages are available at decent price.  CONS: ======= - Swimming pool is not maintained well. You an find algae in pool... Yuck. - They allowed people to use the pool without proper costume specially the caps - Food needs a lift - Expensive for night stay - Need to provide more for kids - Changing rooms should be kept dry all the time"
304,40,"Well this hotel has very huge property located in the outskirts of Bengaluru, the overall experience was very good. If one is looking for a family vacation then you can opt for this. Staffs are well trained, you will have a good food here."
305,40,"So, about a 100 of us descended onto this property for a team outbound.   Check in was pretty smooth. Some rooms are quite a walk from the lobby with a buggy on call for those needing help.   Rooms are a bit dated but have a warm and comfy ambience.   The pool is massive and well maintained. There are a multitude of indoor and outdoor sports for guests to spend time on.   Food was good with the breakfast buffet especially being a lavish and sumptuous spread. "
306,30,"We went to Golden Palms a few months back on a family outing. The lush, verdant grounds (the rains must have helped), large pool (with a larger than usual toddler pool and separate areas for swimming, water volleyball, and a shallow play area with showers), and huge buffet spread were the highlights of the place. The buffet in particular was way better than expected, with outdoor live grills and cooking stations serving everything from cotton candy and popcorn to barbecue, chaat, Thai and Chinese food--all unlimited, all with a smile. The indoor dining area had traditional, good buffet fare; the salads and cold meats were above average.   What we didn’t like (and the reasons the resort is rated average): 1) The resort mandates the use of swimming costumes in the pool and the…"
307,50,"The resort is located some 20 km outside the city, very close to the Bangalore International Exhibition Center (BIEC). The rooms are big and comfortable, all with view to the beautiful garden with the palm trees. The hotel has a very big outdoor swimming pool, and a nice bar near the pool. They also have Tennis and Squash courts. The staff are extremely friendly and helpfull at all times and breakfast is rich and very tasty. They also provide free WiFi to all of devices."
308,30,"This resort is widely spread, very green and has spacious rooms. Hotel needs renovation and improvement in service. Food quality is just okay....Will recommend professionals those who want to save time and have event in Bangalore International Exhibition centre (BIEC. It just takes 15 mins from hotel to reach BIEC"
309,50,Visited the Golden Palms Hotel & Spa on Tumkur Road in Bangalore. It was company day out with families. The resort staff are very cooperative and courteous and had arranged everything as per our request. The overall ambiance of the resort is wonderful with enough greenery and activities rolled into one.  The food was excellent and the chef's choice menu could cater all the palates including our Japanese colleagues.   The entire day spent at the resort was excellent. I would strongly recommend a visit.  One disadvantage is the time to reach the resort from from the city is high due to the traffic on Tumkur Road and the need to travel on the service road after the toll booth.
310,30,"Have stayed here on a few occasions mostly as part of my company retreats .. Restaurant serves buffet breakfasts and lunch .. many companies use this property for team outings .. they have a big swimming pool, but its not maintained properly these days .."
311,40,"Stayed here for one night with family, check in process was very smooth and people were courteous. Its a sprawling property with lots of greenery around, swimming pool is really large, we were excited to see the pool and spent most of our time in that area. Sports facilities are also good but can be better, i could see many people waiting to get their chance.   Best part was the food, we had all 3 meals in the resort and was amazed with the spread and taste.. its really worth it. Drinks on the pool side is an advantage.   I could see lots of corporate groups visiting the place which makes it a bit crowded during weekend... they have lot of walk in customers as well. Our check out was on Saturday and I was not surprised to see the lobby filled with people waiting to get in.  …"
312,40,"So the property is very nicely built. From the reception to the big room to clean gardens, a big swimming pool, 4 restro, 2 bars, badminton, squash, TT, what not.. the facilities are amazing. You can go there and enjoy very much if you are in family. The bad part is the service. You call people to take plates, and you wait for hours and noone comes. They are surely understaffed, and the people running don't even care. Saw some rude behavior in the breakfast where people were complaining. The breakfast is terrible, not much variety, not much taste, and all chaos, it feels like 3-4 people managing 100+ people and everyone around looking unhappy. So apart from the breakfast and service, the property is very nice. You might want to think if service and breakfast is more important or…"
313,40,"Golden Palms Resort & Spa is a good place to Relax & Unwind for people staying in Bangalore. It's about 25 kms distance on National Highway 4 (NH4) from UB City & takes about 1 hour to travel by car. Since it's not too far from the hustle & bustle of city, it's an ideal getaway for people( couples & families) who want to have a quiet & relaxing weekend. The resort is very very peaceful & calm.The resort is quiet big & lots of greenery to sooth your eyes. The Spa in the resort is good & has separate jacuzzi for ladies & gents to relax & de-stress yourself. The resort has a very large swimming pool with a small pool area for kids as well.

We were truly excited to see such a huge swimming pool with huge variety of stater , unlimited chilled beer, lavish Sunday brunch with D.J and many other activity. Special thanks to Ajay Talukdar, Krishnan from F&B & entire team of Golden Palms for making our day out enjoyably."
315,50,"Had been here with friends , we really loved their breakfast buffet.The resort is well maintained with lots of amenities.Spend a day or two you wouldn be disappointed , even though it's on the expensive side totally worth it."
316,50,Amazing stay by my organisation ..rooms were very clean with an awesome service....very calm and relaxing place have ever been to...Highly recommended for team outings or to just pamper yourself :) I was totally in love with this place :)
317,40,"Was here for a team outing- Excellent Location, very big and beautiful pool. lots of space to roam around. Breakfast was really good, but lunch was very average. Good service and hospitality. Not far away from City. Good trainers for team building activities. But the indoor game area was poorly maintained. You need to pay Rs 60 for a shuttlecock. Foosball board was damaged, also other indoor games. It was disappointing. But Overall its value for money. Don't miss the pool fun here."
318,40,"I was just checked out from this hotel and all I can say is it has its own charm. The colonial style building blends with its centered garden which support a wild life as I hear many birds there. The birds are even joining the breakfast!! The hospitality is there, the facilities are sufficient, and the longer I stay, the better it feels. Coming from the notable tourist destination with best hotels around; Bali, I didn't expect too much at first, but everyone was friendly and accommodating. The room is large and the bathroom serves its purpose. And by the end of the day, all you can memorize is the hospitality offered. One thing that might be considered by the management is the breakfast selection. It will be better to have more 'international' selection, because not everyone…"
319,10,"This used to be great when it was owned by Sanjay Khan is what I have heard from hotel industry colleagues.. The new owners do not seem to be bothered about how the hotel is being run. Being from the hospitality industry itself I generally have high levels of tolerance towards any shortcomings at any hotel as I understand the situation from their side as well.. So if I have to write such straight reviews you could think how really agonised I am by this experience. The only thing good about the hotel is the building (though needs some maintainance). Staff is all laid back and the first response to anything you ask at an F&B outlet is ""NO"". When you give them a piece of your mind they pull up their socks and get things done. Stewards don't bother to serve food. I had a lady…"
320,30,"We were here for the team outing& the place looks average no different from a regular one.Its very far from the city.the reception looks fine.Food quality average.They really have a great pool.large one.But the guard is the spoiler there.he continuously whistles over everyone harshly .it spoils the peace near the pool.he insists over all to buy the swim suit at higher prices.they don let if you will have nylon tees & nylon shorts also.you need to have a proper swim suit ,to be very precise you must be buying a perfect swim suit from the resort. The indoor activity centre is good. no separate dance floor. overall a boring average experience."
321,40,"Was here for a conference. Situated in Bengaluru 's outskirts this place is quite spacious and pleasant. But it's so spacious , you might prefer a buggie to negotiate the place.Swimming pol is quite large. Rooms are well appointed. Food was above average most of the time"

323,10,"Very worst experience, pool side walls have algae settled. Mr. Kabir who was in charge was ruthless, when we asked for the pool towels , he said have you got them, If yes then use them or else they will provide you. Even for the locker, he says that if there are 50 persons also there is only one locker for them. And also if there is a single man they will provide only one locker, disgusting. Never ever try to visit them"
324,20,"Well...I hope you all know that this resort is one of the costliest resorts around bangalore and  never ever felt that its worth of it during my 1st visit. This is the 1st resort I visited , which asks you to checkout on time, when i was just  about to check in !!! The front desk guys seriously need some training on how to speak to customers. Now coming to room : The room was kind of spacious but badly maintained. The TV and the card slot did not work properly , the balcony had some furnitures but looking at them one can be sure that they were not cleaned for ages .  They do have a quite big swimming pool , but hey ! Its not the size but cleanliness that matters more. Kid's pool was just for namesake , they did not had any sort of arrangements for kids there , worse the water…"
325,30,Hi !! this property is around 1 hr away from the airport towards the outskirts of Bangalore.The in house services are bad. You need to call them again and again to respond.. be it the concierge or the house keeping. I stayed there for 2 nights and found no difference in the buffet menu for breakfast... The food is ok types... The WiFi does not work in major areas. The rooms are good but the services really need a consideration.
326,10,"This was a terrible place. Last week our entire team of 30 members visited this place . The washroom clearly showed it needed more attention . The facilities they provided like the games was not all that great too, It was just like any other resort.  Last but not the least the food was hopeless. There were flies tasting the food along with us. When we told their staff about this NO action was taken. Bad maintenace. Half of our team fell sick after visiting this place. So folks beware this place sucks. Don't go there to fall sick. There are tons of better places out there."

We stayed 1 night and had 2 breakfasts, 2 lunches, 1 dinner, tea/coffee + snacks as included with the package.   The place is lush green, clean, quite and relaxed. A perfect offsite location in my view.   MEETING ROOMS: While the meeting rooms are spacious, well lit and have the necessary basic infrastructure in place, a slight clean up would help. Further to that the meeting / presentation infrastructure can get an uplift... with communication and presentation technology changing so rapidly, it would be great if the GP Management can keep pace with time.  FACILITIES: The arrangement for the meeting rooms, location, tea/coffee + snacks is pretty much what would you expect at these…"

Then the bad phase started, they refused on many promises while checking in and blamed that their sales person (Shilpa) in Indiranagar office who has made mistakes and that they cannot provide those benefits now. Even after being their member (unfortunately), they refused to provide me a complementary bouquet which was promised while buying membership.

329,40,"I went with 2 of my friends for a day trip to relax in the pool. The pool is excellent with very clear water. We also used lawn tennis and it was as good as the other indoor games which they have. Whenever you plan for a day-trip in Bangalore, Golden Palm should be on your list."
330,40,"An ideal property to get away from the hustle bustle of the city. Ideal for corporate s as well as those looking for a day out. large swimming pool. Great ambiance and soothing greenery all around. The species of flora around u, mesmerizes u. Must be a herculean task to take care of such a large and scattered property. We had got a suite. It was wonderful. Buffet is okay. would love staying again."

It is not too far away from Bangalore city, and has a lot of green space.  The pool is amazing...I think one of the biggest,. and the chilren have a lot of options to play.

333,50,We recently visited the place for team outing. It is a great place for the same. There are many outdoor games and indoor games (including squash). The restaurant menu was amazing. The swimming pool is huge and nicely done. The resort itself is nicely decorated.
334,30,"It's  a huge  property with  beautiful  view.. Spa facilities are Very good n recommended.Rooms and it's interiors are excellently done with private balcony and good view. Buffet was OK. Going with your partner you can have relaxed time away from hustle bustle of the city but that is true for any resort. Overall decent experience. Improvement Areas: staff should be efficient enough to manage guests at the same time. When we and many other guests arrived, they took 2 hours to allocate rooms. That is quite bad. If there would have been indoor or outdoor games, two days stay makes sense else one day is good to experience it. Staff should be interactive! This I feel is the most problematic area with this resort. Only interaction is the billing time. No proper welcome. After spending…"
335,50,"Our recent visit to the resort was one of the best we ever had. The Golden Palms Hotel and Spa is at par and in some ways superior to some of the best hotels we have stayed in India and abroad.  We stayed in Deluxe suites. The rooms were excellent with a private garden and balcony.  The food was awesome. The spread was huge with great taste.  The Sunday Brunch is something not to be missed at all. Unlimited food, beer and barbecue made our day. The highlight of the resort is the pool....which is huge. DJ by the pool, great restaurants and amazing service. By the night, the scene at the poolside turns even better with loud music, great lighting and poolside dinner. The SPA is another highlight of the resort. It was a ultimate relaxing experience. We were pampered and felt…"
336,50,"Would like to share our experience here over the weekend, which was absolutely fantastic. We were about 25 of us accommodated at the presidential suites. Gorgeous suites with well stocked amenities. Food at the buffet was good, but the highlight of evening was the private barbecue! Simply delicious. Lamb, basa fish, pineapple, paneer among Thanks to Mr.Sandeep Muralidharan for taking extra care to make this family get together a very special one.  The only feedback we had as a group was the refrigerators in the room, which was not efficient & the cutlery used in the restaurants are very large! Pls change them to smaller ones."
337,30,"We had been to this resort, stayed there for 1 night. We were a group of 25. Welcome was really bad.  The staffs were very rude. No good response from the staffs. Indoor games were very limited. 1 t.t, 2 carrom board, 2 snooker tables.  Badminton is in outdoor, so u basically cannot enjoy badminton outside. Cricket play area is good enough to enjoy. BEST PART OF THIS RESORT IS THE SWIMMING POOL. JUST LOVED IT.   BAD : VEG FOOD IS PATHETIC THERE.  SAME BUFFET MENU FOR LUNCH AND DINNER.   "
338,10,"Goldens palms is full of problems from the start till end of my visit to the resort.  the people are not bothered about the feelings of the people visiting the resort.  inspite of informing the management about the problems no botheration.  Food is bad, TV does not work, water problems in the room, in the spa they dont have ladies attender.   Never visit"
339,10,"The service is worst, the staff is not helpful. It's not your money's worth. They have one of the most terrible services. The management is terrible, you have to help yourself. Very expensive, it's good for couples and family but if you are visiting with your friends please avoid there is nothing to do."
340,40,Was there for a cousin's wedding. The ambience is great. The rooms are good and sizeable The service is good. The swimming pool is huge and one of the best. Very good for pool side parties. The food was decent. Overall a very good venue for weddings and similar functions.
341,50,"it was a best team outing, great place to unwind and relax and to be away from all the daily hustle and bustle of the city.  except the swimming pool. everything was fine. and there was a lot of indoor and outdoor games."
342,40,We went with family for the weekend and were very disappointed with theri service. there was a wedding planned i wish they had told us when we were booking. tons of people and badly managed food service. we felt cheated. not worth the money that we paid.
343,40,Although I stayed here only for a day but the experience was truly amazing.The food was too good and the place is nicely maintained. The cleanliness has to be appreciated. Staff was polite and service was good. Overall a good experience.
344,40,"This place is really a great place to unwind and relax and to be away from all the daily hustle and bustle of the city. The property is beautifully spread in a quiet setting. The resort makes you feel somewhat that you are in goa and not in bengaluru. The breakfast, lunch and dinner buffet is a lavish spread. The service is prompt and all staff are friendly and helpful. The resort has a nice equipped gym, squash court, billiard tables, tennis and badminton courts to help you sweat and continue your workout even when you are on a holiday. Its a great place to spend with the family."
345,40,"Its not for no reason that Golden Palms is considered one of the best resorts in Bengaluru. It is a complete package in every aspect. Although I was there for a business convention, I almost instantly felt like coming here on a personal visit. It displayed in lot ways , character of a good resort So here is my word on all aspects:  Location: very close to the main hiway (bengaluru-mumbai) and still a little away from the hustle bustle of the green city. Its tucked away with open fields even around the property giving it ample fresh breezy air.  Property: its spread across at least 10acres and boasts of all amenities you  would ask for in a premium property.  Star attraction is it's very large pool ,probably the biggest I have seen so far in any resort and it sort of ensures u…"
346,20,"The property is nice with nice rooms, good amenities and a beautiful swimming pool. Food was good, although very expensive (expected @ any luxury property). But the hospitality and attitude of the staff is really pathetic. No one bothers about the guests. Probably because it’s so well established and gets good number of guests, in spite of such treatment, just because of the brand name. We had a terrible experience worth writing, so other fellow travelers best avoid this place. We stayed at Golden Palms on the 2nd of May 2015. We reached the resort around 12:30PM, check-in time being 12:00PM. We were told that the room was getting cleaned by housekeeping and separate twin beds would be replaced by regular King sized beds in half an hour. We patiently waited and finally were…"
347,50,"Was there with couple of my friends and business colleagues and simply loved the hotel from Lobby to the rooms then a view from the balcony , cozy rooms with the best of service .... what a pool they have ... was the fav place when there all the time either in pool or in the room with a view to the pool ...Must recommend if travelling for a long trip as the Resort itself will take 1-2 days for you the explore ..."
348,30,"Place is nice full of greenery , big clean swimming pool, but horrible room service and very much expensive .They take  40- 60 minutes to supply for room dining. They dont write order properly and send partial order even after long time.  Rest other things are good. breakfast was awesome.   In my case some extra bar bills ( not consumed by us )  was added which they later cancelled."
349,50,"I had opportunity to stay at this property in connection with office matter from 16/05/ to 19/05/2015.  The weather at Bengaluru is pleasant always and every day rains during my stay added an additional topping.  The property is situated around 50 kms from Air port on off Tumkur road.  Travel time is minimum 1 hour or more if you are struck in traffic.  It is maintained property with lots of greenery around.  You can see mango, chicku, Amla, Jackfruit trees loaded with fruits.  You can simply have a walk around the property in a serene atmosphere.  The only flaw I could notice is Reception area is not Air Conditioned and if you have to wait for a while till you check-in or after check-out, it is a bit unconfortable."
350,30,I was disappointed with my one night stay here. I only give the average rating because it was a fun place for the 8 children we had in our group.  What went wrong?  -  The rooms smell musky and of Cockroach spray - The service at the restaurant was way below standard. They are understaffed and have average food. waited for almost 1 hour for a plain dosa at breakfast! - The pool side restaurant has only 1 baby chair - shocking for a place that boasts of having the largest pool in south India! - The restaurant did not have tea spoons as part of their cutlery - come on these are basics guys.. I had to ask someone for tea spoons least 10 times before I got one. - AC did not work well in the room despite efforts to fix it by maintenance - it seems to stop working in the middle of the…
351,40,"Bangalore weather works its own magic & makes a normal place look fabulous and this is no different. This resort beautifully situated on the outskirts of Bangalore makes a visit worthwhile. First things, first- its HUGE! One of its biggest USP is the size of the swimming pool which is truly breathtaking. With bar surrounding it, makes for a pretty sight. It has 3-4 restaurants and food is above average. We had an offsite visit and the gardens provided a good environment for activities. Another good part is the indoor-games section- TT, carrom, pool, Fusbol! There are cycles for people who may want to take a self-tour of this property."
352,50,"It is located on Tumkur road. Sprawling proprty. Absolute calm and serenity. Cottages are really very big even for a family of 4. Well appointed rooms with two sets of toilets, long balcony and reception  area. Room service, house keeping are very prompt. Clean and comfortsble toilets. Food quality is good. Very large swimming pool. All cottages are overlooking the pool. Lot of indoor, outdoor game opportunities. Total privacy. Suitable for rest, relaxation and corporate meetings. Suitable for honeymooners. Reasonable tariff. Enjoyable indeed"
353,40,"You feel awesome once you enter this place. Its very much accessible from Bangalore via tumkur road exit On Nice road. It has nice spa , huge swimming pool and 3 restaurants. This place is ideal for family or corporate visits. The buffet is one of the best I have seen in any Bangalore resorts. It has buffet for breakfast as well as lunch. The spa staff is good and provides great service. Their indoor game facility is not that great and it needs an upgrade. Overall a great place you should visit around Bangalore.  It provides day package also for visitors."
354,40,"we went there  on office outing.. It is located in outskirts of city.. far away from pollution and traffic(once you reached there.. :P).. Rooms were Clean, Swimming Pool was quite big..Games facilities are ample for weekend which includes squash, tennis, table tennis etc.. Food Was good... Overall it was a good experience to have"
355,10,"We visited this resort only to find them v v unprofessional approach towards the customers ..  Food was pathetic .. I am amazed to see the 5 star ratings given to them .. Total lie ..  Their swimming pool too was very dirty and didn't even have the basic facilities like tube , clean towels .. Uffffff.. I am so pissed  wasting my time on these idiots ..  Ppl beware , do not go on the brand .. It's a total lie and sheer waste of money .."
356,10,I conducted a workshop for a Global company last week in the hotel. I returned after 10 years and could not believe what had happened. The entire hotel is looking in a run down condition. It is manned by a large number of UB trained young staff. The service was poor. The wireless did not work all day despite several complaints! There was an iron board in the room but no electric iron! The last straw was when the staff did not give me a wake up call as scheduled! Please avoid this hotel!
357,30,Been there quite a few times. It's nice resort to spend 1-2 days with family away from daily chores. Nice resort with average facilities. But the service and the food over here is not at par. Swimming pool is also not very good.
358,10,"A group of 5 UK friends booked a day trip to this hotel on the recommendation of one of the party, who visited around 8 years ago.  We contacted the hotel in advance (approx 72 hours before) and requested to make a booking. We were given an internet link to make the booking, which we did around 48 hours before arrival.  We arrived early in the morning to make the most of our visit, however immediately we were hounded by staff asking for a copy of our booking, which we provided immediately. We started to enjoy our day and we were approach a number of further times asking to see the booking confirmation again, which after 3 or 4 times we were starting to get a little irate.  After spending a couple of hours by the pool bar we were approached by what I would assume is the hotel…"
359,50,"It was a pleasant stay there at Golden Palm, good food Service and Rooms.  The staff starting from the Lobby to the Room Service, Resto etc.  The Swimming pool is the most amazing part of the Hotel.  The spa is also very spacious and attrative."
360,30,"This is a great big property with many facilities. The pool is surely the most amazing part of the resort. And the rooms overlook the wide spread lawns. Great place to relax and enjoy. They have a cricket ground, shuttle badminton, squash, football nets, snooker, ping pong and foosball. U can reall enjoy out here. Only caveat is that the property is kinda getting old. It surely could use a facelift in some areas. This has been around for a long time now."
361,50,Its a wonderful property...with one of the biggest pool...and lots n lots of greenery.  Room size is good with each room having its private balcony where in u can just sit nd relax...watching nature....will surely come back again..
362,30,"Came here as part of a conference. Still here, leaving Sun morning. Place is about an hour from the airport. The property is quite lavishing spread out. They layout is a garden & pool area in the centre with rooms all round it. Each block is two storied.   Room Room furnitures are antediluvian. They have a cabinet which you literally need to struggle with to open. I saw the same thing in two other rooms where delegates were staying. The mini fridge didn't work. Bed isn't that comfortable but okay I guess. The best part is the balcony which overlooks the pool area & garden. There's a TV but unless they assume everyone to follow regional languages it's not worth the time, there's barely 3-4 English channels.   I don't know how many power outages they had past two days and not sure…"
363,50,"I am still staying at this Hotel till Sunday 12th April 2015. I must say the Hotel is a perfect gateway for Family and Peace lovers. The Hotel is equipped with all the Modern Facilities and it is far from City so that you can breath a very good quality Air. Whole hotel is crowded with different kinds of Plants which provide fresh Air. Hotel has a very big Swimming Pool. Excellent Cafeteria, GYM (I must say very good Gym), Sauna Bath, Steam Bath, SPA facility etc. A very good weekend gateway for the People living in and Around Bangalore. The hotel staff is extra supportive and will help you in every manner. I did faced internet Problem and was shifted to another room immediately. Thanks for the support. I am here for an Information Security Award Reception Ceremony."
364,50,"We visited the resort in a large group of 13 adults and 8 kids. We really enjoyed the resort - the kids loved the pool, the service was friendly, the rooms were spacious and comfortable. What was really great, given some young kids in the group, the flexibility of the staff to help us out. Master Chef B N Ghosh at the restaurant went out of his way to volunteer and prepare dishes which the kids wanted (for example, the breakfast buffet did not have poori, Master Chef concocted a poori subji at short notice). A couple of areas for the resort to work on: sometimes the room keys do not work, and the A/C at the restaurant needs to be more powerful (though the management wheeled in a cooler to help us when we pointed out that it was a trifle warm within the restautant). I would…"
365,40,"This is really a plus size resort. The rooms are large, comfortable and airy and opens to a private verandah! The verandah opens to a large courtyard, which is really a coconut grove, well maintained. The rooms are arranges around the periphery of the property with this large farmland in the middle that makes the place look really big. The swimming pool is massive too, so big that it can fit all the guests still you won't feel uncomfortable venturing into the pool.  The food is awesome too, a very fine spread indeed. We stayed one night, had lunch, dinner and breakfast, all buffet.   The sports and games center also has a large number of games and activities, including squash, tennis, badminton, caroms, chess, etc... Good indeed.  There is a large jogging track around the…"
366,50,"I was planning a quick getaway from Bangalore to a nice Resort. This was a perfect one. Lush Green, Awesome swimming pool, good food, perfect drive from city through NICE road.   Overall awesome experience. Would recommend it without hesitation."
367,30,"I stayed there for 3 nights and following are my experience.  First the Good things about the Resort: 1. The pool is very good 2. 3-4 Types of restaurants. 3. Quite green, feels good when you have a walk. 4. it's off road hence good place for a peaceful getaways.  Bad Part about the resort: 1. Food is over expensive (600 ml Coke they charge 150 + taxes) 2. Rooms are not up to the mark of a 5 star resort (what the management claims) 3. Staff are not very courteous. They called me twice to vacate the room, one at night and one at 6.30 in the morning, although for check-out the timing was 11'o clock  I can see lots of corporate outings are happening during my stay. I guess that how this resort is for."
368,40,"Me and my colleagues went for the office outing here. We had a nice time, facilities are good, pool is the best part of the resort. Lovely place to relax. Though there were a few negatives like the lousy housekeeping, most of the facilities are good. Good for corporate outings or for families."
369,30,"I travel quite often, and this time I happen to stay at Golden Palms Hotel & Spa for my one week official trip. The hotel has a great view. It's greenery view is verity of plantation is unique which is beyond appreciation. The swimming pool stretch is very large and it was great to see such beautiful view in the heart of the hotel. I really enjoyed the greenery and swimming pool view. However,  the facility provided by the staff was very sluggish and basic facility and utility in the room was missing. In my room their was no short towel (and only one towel was provided), iron was missing, the internet facility was very poor and etc.  In addition, without any consent, I got wake up call from reception at 6:25 am which was shocking to me. There was several other instances which…"
370,20,"We stayed at the resort for one night on 14th March. The hotel is not at all value for money, and is very overpriced for the facilities and services it offers. The room had a bed which looked couple of decades old, and was a real turn-off. The bathroom knob came out during night and caused great annoyance as it could not be closed thereafter. Tv in the room did not work for long durations and did not have basic music channels.   The only shining light probably was the ayurvedic massage we took the next morning."
371,20,I stayed at the resort for one night on the 7th of March. The rooms were decent but the facilities is something that has to be improved drastically to justify us spending 7000 Rs per night. There is no dress code for the pool. Its disappointing to see that a star resort like Golden palms allows children into the pool with no swimsuit not even underpants. Was totally sick to see children as big at 8 years entering the pool completely naked.  The bathroom had no bucket and when i requested for one as I had to bathe my 8 month old baby I was given a Blue bucket with a rusted silver handle and the inside of the bucket had mud and the outside had white stains. Wish I had clicked a picture. I was aghast to see a star hotel give such a filthy bucket. I ended up bathing my baby with a…
372,30,We had a good time at the resort. However the maintenance was not upto the mark. The suite we stayed in was beautiful. Food was good too. The resort had all the club house facilities etc. Overall an average stay experience
373,50,"I have been staying at this property for the entire week for an International event organized at BEIC by the India Smart Grid Forum, with the Secretary of the Ministry of Power and high profile world leaders.  I have enjoyed the magnificence and relaxing atmosphere of the Golden Palms hotel, and the friendly assistance of the staff.  I have ordered laundry service (large number of items) yesterday and it came back impeccable. Then I decided today to see if your laundry service could take up a challenge: I had a shirt stained by some birds while visiting a bird park in Singapore.  We tried to have it cleaned in Singapore, then  in Europe, then in the US, in Korea, in Japan. No one has succeeded to remove the large brownish stain ! Yogesh B.K. just brought me back the shirt: he…"
374,50,"I had been to this place for a day. Though it was a very hectic visit, I liked the beautiful landscape with full of greenery giving calming effect.  Food was awesome.... Looking forward to visit again... for longer duration to enjoy everything it has to offer."
375,50,I stayed here for 5 nights and every part of my stay was so fantastic! The staff went OVER and ABOVE to make sure I had everything I needed to enjoy my stay. I can't get over how hard all of the banquet staff work - we had almost all of the same friendly faces serving us for a 3-day wedding. They were all always smiling. Everyone was so nice and accommodating and added special touches wherever they could. Thank you for such an incredible memory. You will always have a special place in my heart!
376,20,"Today is 2 March 2015 and i checked-in at almost 9:30 pm for a 4 day stay. The problems started as soon as the check-in began. I called the Hotel from the Airport to tell them that i was arriving and despite that there was no clarity as to which room should be allotted to me and it took some time to finalize it. The reception desk assistant was a nice chap and despite the delays did an excellent job.  i wanted to take a shower and wash my hair but saw that the bathroom did not have a hair conditioner. i asked for some and was provided with some body lotion, when I re-emphasized that i need a hair conditioner i was told that the hotel does not offer that.   I let that go and decided to order some food. i ordered a Pan seared stuffed chicken breast with raisin sauce and Butter…"
377,40,Golden Palms is a nice property. I visited this place with the Team and it was a great experience. It has a very good swimming pool… the food is simply awesome and so is customer service! Very nice place to relax over a weekend. Only disadvantage is that it is little far from city.
378,50,"The foremost appreciation is for the Excellent Staff Hospitality.  I have been with my friends and thoroughly enjoyed most of the activities. There are both Indoor and Outdoor activities which makes you rejoice and splash with refreshing mood!!  Have now decided to visit again for Family Trip! :)  Some of the attractions:  Great space with the shades of Trees, makes you feel like you are in Tropical Forest. Real BIG Swimming Pool Excellent Gourmets Wider & spacious indoor games"
379,20,"It was a lovely hotel on very big grounds and pretty gardens. The pool was absolutely freezing so although it was hot during our stay, it wasn’t too comfortable to cool off in there due to such cold temperatures.  The rooms were very spacious and bathroom was beautiful. During our stay however, the water was shut off throughout the complex, meaning we were not in any way able to shower, or use the toilets. Nor were any portable toilets placed on site. This remained for a full 24 hours. This was incredibly difficult to manoeuvre around especially with 3 IBS sufferers, all on malaria tablets - I’m sure I don’t have to spell it out that the toilet would have been in use an awful lot! Of course this caused great embarrassment and discomfort for us who were sharing rooms! The only…"
380,20,"Service is average.Food quality is poor,Very less Variety in food. Terrible Restroom. It was looking like Public Toilet ..not clean at all. Concert Hall is very Good. Parking is not up to the mark. Swimming Poll is not so good..average. Only Few games & Event managed. Club Cabana is better than Place.Facilities are not like 4 Star or 5 star."
381,30,"Located  in the city limits of bangalore but appears a quite serenity, which is its biggest plus point for people who don't want to travel a lot to avoid buzzing city noise.  Spread over 19 acres boasts of a longest swimming pool (130mts). The green serenity has varied flora and fauna.  Rooms are good  (but does not classify into luxury class). Each room have a balcony overlooking the central green spine area and pool.  The spread of food available is average on the buffet.   Over all would be a great place for small weekend stays without travelling a lot."
382,30,Stayed here for 1 night for a business conference ... the property misjudged my return airport flight timings and made a hash of my travel arrangement .... Almost missed my flight !!!! Organisation skills seem to be pretty average :-((  Rooms are large and clean and am sure you will love it :-) .... Food is average though it could be by personal experience ...   Overall a nice place to stay for a few nights .. However quite far from the city and so do not expect to mix it with city tours and late night outs
383,40,"Had a fabulous, wonderful, memorable and rejuvenating experience in this extraordinary Hotel, A very fine property with lush greenery and very big pool at the center which is the most attractive part of the hotel. Rooms were big and nice. Facilities are good like steam & sauna, squash, TT, carom, chess, bicycle to cycle around the big property i.e 800 meter Jogging track. Battery operated vehicle to drop you at your room etc. There are many plus points but obvious some small glitches are also there, staff need to be more trained in hospitality and prompt in service, a touch-up will do and definitely hotel have to improve in food quality and presentation. Rest other is excellent. my rating 4/5."
384,40,Excellent place serene atmosphere beautiful rooms good food nice place to go on a retreat / leisure travel. But far away from city centre / airport. Above all courteous service coupled with right understanding of guest requirement. Morning buffet on week ends are lavish.
385,30,"We (2 families) went there for a day trip during Jan'15. The property is nice, nice palm trees dotting the landscaped gardens, amenities are OK - squash, tennis (both), indoor games, outdoor badminton etc.Tennis court has too much loose clay that makes ball bounce uneven, the tennis balls were in bad shape - I expected much better than this. The big pool was main attraction and lunch was nice too. The Service was so bad/lethargic - may be that day was another big wedding so all waiters were busy with that, but why should I care, they charge very high for food/drinks. Overall just OK place, priced too high, and BAD service."
386,30,"We were on our company outing last year and we found this resort with multiple activities with a hugh swimming pool. Its got a good squash court and good swimming pool, also they have a nice spa and I had never seen a steam area which is as big as a living room. Staff service was very good however the food was average.."
387,40,I was there for a night stay this month to celebrate my wife's birthday. This place is just an hours drive from our house. We reached bang on at check in time but apparently rooms were not ready and getting cleaned. The front office staff is very indifferent and would not even move a finger to make you feel comfortable or wanted in the resort. Anyways we got a room in 30 minutes and checked in. The room itself was beautiful. The doors look dated but once you enter the room it is class apart. Very comfortable rooms. There are multiple dining options and most of them are very decent. The swimming pool is clean but the tiles are chipping off.  In a nutshell everything is good but they look at least a decade old. Maybe redoing and remodelling some of the stuff will do wonders to the…
388,30,"We stayed for 3x days fri- Sunday.It was a family wedding over the 3x days,we virtually took over the hotel.There were lots of staff,dont know if extra were taken on for the event? Like other comments the rooms were dated ,they needed a make over.I dont think any work has gone on since first built .The furniture in room really dated and stained.I would not class this as a 5 start hotel.Rooms were cleaned,but the rubbish bins in bathroom and bedroom never emptied.The rooms could do with a deep clean.The wi-fi is so frustrating! The  room keys would not work,1x time there were ques of people with same problem,the hotel response was always ""dont put key next to your mobiles""?? I cannot comment on food as we never ate in restaurants.One day breakfast was severed in the restaurant by…"
389,40,We went there for a one day outing without a night stay and quite enjoyed our day. It was a fun outing with decent number of activities to do there. We quite enjoyed the sports facilties and spend a good amount of time there. The swimming pool is really good and you can enjoy being in the water the whole day. Since it was quite cold that day we didnt get into the pool. Lunch was quite amazing (better than my expectations). There were a host of options for buffet with unlimited beer and soft drinks. The resort has a really big spa and also seemed a bit expensive. Overall a pretty good one day outing.
390,40,"A good Resort where you can stay peacefully away from the busy, noisy, polluted city(ies). Though old & needing some renovations, the rooms are quite well maintained, clean, well placed and most have a good view. My feeling is that Food (Buffet) here is not value for money unless it is in your package."
391,10,"It's 5th jan midnight. I just checked in. We had booked two rooms(2 families together), first thy have us rooms in separTe buildings to break is. We were very tired so we agreed. The other couple went and we went to our room. The room was not opening and was locked from inside. Far away from reception we waited for the engineer to fix the problem outside the room for 45 minutes, finally the engineer came and ultimately found out that it was an occupied room and people were sleeping inside it.  My bad luck, after lot of fighting at midnight I was alloted another room far away.  In any case the mood is spoiled and tomm I will write the longest complaint ever written in their complain book(if they care)  "
392,10,"I recently went online and booked a room for my Mum who was wanting to spend 3 nights at the resort...it all went well and we received an email saying 'Thank you for your booking, your room is confirmed...blah blah blah....a couple of hours later she receives an email saying that there has been a mistake and that the hotel is fully booked out and therefore her booking is not valid! TUT! TUT! Extremely poor service! Would have been quite interesting to see what would have happened if she had not checked her email and just showed up at the hotel!"
393,30,Was there on 31st dec 2014 n had taken a room for overnight stay after new year party. Good spacious rooms. Very humble staff. Neat and clean rooms and bathroom though it was peak season.very child friendly staff.  I was allotted room no 119 & 120 as we were with kids. It was a bit far from the new year party and was best suited for family.  Would visit again. 
394,40,Went to Golden Palms on a company offsite and loved the experience. The pool is massive and clean. Our meeting rooms were well organized. We partied late into the night right in front of the pool and enjoyed the ambience. Rooms are grand. Breakfast buffet was also with a large variety of options. The only negative was its an old property and hence not everything you will find will be in mint condition.
395,10,"Golden Palms will ensure that you forget anything Golden during your stay! This is an absolute rubbish resort and I have no idea how they are rated 5 star? Really! How?  We were three adults and child(below two years). Without (trying) to be biased in my review, I would list down my experience and then fellow travelers could decide if Golden Palms is 5 star!  Check-in  We arrived at 1:00 PM and were greeted at the reception by guest relations manager - Beena. She was courteous. We were also offered welcome drinks. 1:15 PM and no sign of room keys. After about 10 minutes we were asked to go to our room(room no. 220) and we were taken there in a buggy along with our luggage.  No one introduced us to the services this place has and where the facilities are which is why there is a…"
396,30,"I had been to Golden Palms as part of our team outing.  The property is good.The food is also great. But what I did not like the attitude of the staff in general (I would definitely not blame everyone). They were very skeptical in giving us the gaming equipments. They keep track of things in the register, so what's the big deal? We had to ask them many times for the same. Another problem that we faced that day was there was some king of water shutdown that day. I know that is a requirement but ideally they should have informed us about such things beforehand. So there was no water in washrooms. Small things but then when you are out to enjoy these things definitely spoils the mood. The general attitude definitely needs an improvement!"
397,40,Golden palm belongs to Sanjay khan yep Hritik Roshan father in law... The  resort has awesome property looks like u are in some Caribbean resort.. It has awesome pools and rooms... The only thing hotel staff should do tag the place right on Google maps so in case if some one is using the maps to come to this place they should reach there easily.. Another thing is that its not on main road and Bangalore tumkur highway is so vast that every first timer will miss the U turn.. So I advise to senior management please use bil sign boards so that people can follow those sign boads to reach there.. 
398,50,"I have stayed and also visited this place many a times for a day visit and each the my feeling has been very good. The food, facilities, room and everything seems to good. Staff is also very courteous...the food spread is probably the best I have seen.."
399,50,"Date of visit: December 12, 2014 Was on a off-site for the second time in less than a month and I am pleased  my previous review of this hotel property has been taken very seriously. The resultant: 1 The security at the main gate/ entrance does not frustrate with un-necessary drills 2. The security manning the main entrance checks and scans objects with the help of the baggage scanner and the metal door detector. 3. The wooden surface, fittings and fixtures were found in good repair this time around.  Food and beverage was very good and I did not receive a single negative comment from my group of 120 persons!!  Last but not the least: Mr. Mohanty, Asst Manager- Food and Beverage service was exceptional and so were his team members attending to our group at The Sorrento."
400,50,"It is a very spacious resort with lush greenery all around. The massive pool filled with clear blue water is well maintained and adds to the ambience. The rooms are spacious with comfortable sit outs and provide all basic amenities. The food served has sufficient variety. The staff is courteous and helpful. A great place to relax,unwind and spend quality time with family. You forget"
401,10,Service from check in time till check out was pathetic.   1) Delay of service at the restaurant. I think they have more people coming in than what the staff can handle. Then food quality is really poor for the price they charge. Most IMP they have 4 to 5 restaurants and a pool bar but most of the times corporate events happen so you end up using only 1 restaurant which means same food you taste else order room service which means U end up eating in room like a business traveler. Funny part is even if you share your room no when you go for dining atleast 2 to 3 staff will again come asking for your room no which is irritating. They should actually come to serve you fast rather than trouble you for your room no. Then people come in so much that items run out fast and then you end…
402,50,This is my 5th visit to gp and it's getting better n better with every experience..  Food is excellent   Warm staff  And awesome hospitality unfortunately couldn't experience tha spa services due to time constraints the best resort in bangalore and very well maintained. 
403,40,"Stayed here for 2 days on a company offsite. First impressions... the property is huge and a nature's lover retreat. It feels so fresh being there. The rooms are large and neat. comfortable cozy beds. Every room has a nice view of the property and a private sitting area.  Food is where there is a scope of improvement. The taste was ok, nothing great of most things. The breakfast was ordinary in comparison to what one gets in a five star city property. However there is a unique charm to this resort and the staff is good too."
404,40,"Quite location, , expansive grounds, good food and decent service- (saw and observed personnel of the resort wearing a smile through out, though there was a large crowd and every area beaming with customers) of this hotel makes it an ideal day out location. Rooms are spacious and decently appointed.  Certain areas of the resort such as the lawns and the water bodies could do with some upkeep. Also the wood work and fittings must look better with a coat of varnish sooner.  The entry and exit gates are a tad confusing, but the security personnel are entertaining- they will ask you to open the bonnet of your vehicle- check the boot space- but will not use the underbelly mirror while busily interacting among themselves.  The metal door frame and detector placed at the entrance to…"
405,50,A nice play to stay with family and relax on poolside. Plenty of greenery to refresh. Excellent service and nice staff. Wonderful amenities. A perfect place to enjoy with family on a sunny weekend. Nice stay to cherish.
406,40,"We had organised a 3 day event in this property and we were very happy with the way being treated and a very courteous / professional staff. The Banquet hall was very neat and also the food was quite good. We had no issues and there was a very good co-ordination between operations, F&B & all departments for making our corporate event success.  Overall i would recommend this place for conferences and official meetings."
407,40,much recommendable place for Corporate Outing & personal Holiday..... Staff and Operations team are very well experienced to manage the show.... !!! F&B team are specially experienced to manage & serve large crowd.
408,40,This was my 6th or 7th trip and i was impressed with the improving standards of the property. It is sad that the location is not the best bangalore has to offer ( which is not much in the sense of traffic management). Cutting through the heavy lorries in the industrialised suburb of bangalore one reaches to an oasis of sorts and it is worth it at the end:-)
409,20,"We had a company meeting there and it was not at all upto the mark. Rooms were looking very old. We stayed for 2 days and no one is interested to change soaps, and dont expect hot water to be hot , it would be warm only. For playing games timings are from 7 AM to 10 PM , no one would be there by 7 AM , we need to wait for them to arrive and provide kits. By the time we went in to ground at 7 AM some one else is already playing and he said that they are their members. ""If you have members assign a separate court for guests also"". Its an outdoor badminton court and they only sell feather shuttles which are not at all suitable for playing. The bats provided by them are shaped out and please ensure that you take a pain killer later.  Coming to our meeting room, it is quite spacious…"
410,40,"My wife and I stayed at the resort between 18th and 20th October, on the occasion of our Wedding Anniversary. It was just a 45 minutes drive for us, as we stay just about 20 kms away. The best landmark for visitors entering from either ways, is the 'Himalaya Drug House' on the national Highway. As we enter the smaller road that leads towards the resort, there are boards that guide us. The Google maps GPS is accurate anyways  It was a weekend and as expected, the crowd was quite big when we entered the resort at around 11AM on the 18th. We were greeted by Mr. Sanjeev who was very hospitable and requested us to bear for 10 minutes so that the corporate registrations are completed. We took a big walk inside the huge estate and the first impression was very good indeed. Considering…"
411,40,This is my second visit to Golden Palms. Their breakfast spread is great. Lunch very disappointing with no starters and hardly any choice of desserts.  The staff was very cordial and Mr Surender took care of all our requirements. They helped in conducting treasure hunt and tug of war events and our employees had a gala time. Swimming pool is great and pool volley ball was very enjoyable. We could not use all the sports facilities as indoor facilities were usurped by other guests. The rooms were great and well  maintained. Could not avail Spa as the bookings were full.  One of my cribs would be this is very expensive if visited as self instead of company outing. Overall a property worth exploring and has enough amenities to occupy oneself with.
412,20,"I considered the Golden Palms for a weekend day-out with my family in the first week of October. Having visited various other resorts in the city and outstation I found the facility and services to be highly overrated, and definitely not 5 start quality. I would rate it 2-3 star overall. It appears that when it was built a decade ago it might have been really classy for those days but it is very apparent that poor maintenance has resulted in this resort losing its sheen in just a decade.   When I had called the previous day to make a reservation I was given a rate of Rs. 1320 + taxes per person as a Sunday day-out rate which included Breakfast, Lunch, Evening Tea and usage of the sport facilities. However, when I landed there I was shown a different rate card with Rs.…"
413,30,Ample space and lots of free space you can play with your family and kids...with a facelift I think this can be convert to a better resort and that will justify the price for one night stay. I think the management focus is to attract the corporate crowd for a day event and nothing different from any other resorts.
414,50,Two week back i and my wife have visit  to my nephew marriage in this beautiful well architecture resort in India this resort on the line Tipu sultan era and nameing of there suites were against their names. Everything about this resort is Large. Very beautiful huge swimming pool and nice green property.  24X7 restaurant along with 3 other restaurants gave us a great variety of food at all times.  As we have visited for marriage ceremony there all the function were organised there and their we got to eat all kind food and without stress we enjoyed the marriage ceremonies for 2 days  Enjoyed a lot
415,40,"HI all, We stayed in Golden Palms from Aug29-Aug31 2014. I must say, the experience was very good.  The food was delicious and there was a good crowd. The indoor sports like Caram, Chess, Squash, TT and outdoor sports like badminton and tennis was very relaxing. We stayed in presidential suites which were very neat and comformatble. No complaints gthere at all.  Coffee for 1 person costs 350 Rupees and that was the only expensive item (not very tasty as well). But you can certainly ahve cofee at the lunch tables where there is a separate counter, Works cheaper as well and is tastier.  The only concern i had was that the pool cannot be used without swimming szuites anbd this is not mentioned in the website. I bought one for myself (approx700) nd for my son."
416,20,"M last visit to this hotel was over 8 years ago and I had very fond memories and hence took the entire family along. Unfortunately, I came away with very mixed feelings over the weekend. I had booked myself and the extended family for 8 rooms over their weekend day-out package and had added the Sunday brunch as optional extra.   Without going into too many details - Positives first - 1. The location is not too far from Bangalore and ideal for a quick getaway. 2. The food is still good and appetizing 3. The pool is large and good for a swim, please see negative list too.  Negative, the list is long - 1. The room that we were assigned had a non working phone. Had to go to the neighboring room to call house keeping. House keeping was asking me if the phone in the toilet was working…"
417,20,"I would like to share my experience at this resort. We were a team of about 15 members who chose the day out package here. I'm overly disappointed with this place for multiple reasons.  First, the facilities you provide do not complement the huge landscape. There is a very beautiful swimming pool which is the biggest attraction and (apparently)a cricket ground which we didn't bother to visit because a group of less than 30 members are not allowed to enjoy this. Why? I think 15-20 members is still fine. That's your policy, fine. Second, you have just one TT table, one lawn tennis court, two outdoor badminton courts which are pretty badly maintained(almost slipped and fell twice!), two squash courts and one snooker/billiards room but you invite over 50-100 people on a single day.…"
418,30,The property is reducing it's value day by day one of the most seeked out property has come down with its value with increasing competition they are unable to cope up with it and stagnant fascility but the rooms and food are good just that amenities and service is very stale so it's time to cope up with the running time is what I would suggest so the hotel is for the old time likers no complaint but not as satisfactory as it had to be
419,30,"We had a family outing for 2 nights here and it was not great at all considering the amount of money you are spending here. We reached at 12.30 PM on the check-in date and got a room in half an hour. But to our surprise, half of the items were missing they showed up in website. We specifically asked for a queen sized bed as we had a kid but got a bed with two mattresses. After complaining we got another room but it took 15/20 phone calls and 3 hours to arrange us another room. Yes i am right, 3 hours. Room is no wonder good and staffs were great. We reached for lunch one of the restaurants which was serving buffets. It was short of tables, chaotic and also short of staffs. Food here are usually expensive due to the 5 star tag.The taste was okay and you have quite a few options…"
420,40,"Old but huge property, food quality is good.. big swimming pool, pollution free area.. rooms are nice and all are swimming pool and garden facing.. Free Wifi available.. Overall good property.. check all the online portals to get the best price for your stay."
421,10,"We visited the hotel so considered to be five star on 15th Aug-16 Aug with family. We were three couples and our agony started right from Check in. The check took around 1.5 hours for which they gave one room to keep us silent. The worst was yet to come. The lunch was inclusive and it was like a shabby place where there were deficiency of table, staffs, messy surrounding. We had one infant and one kid. When we asked the room service to warm the food for the infant we were shocked to hear that they don't have policy to entertain outside food. Gosh... spare the infants pl. The overall theme was chaotic with corporate outings, inhouse residents and we felt that we made a big mistake by spending such high cost on no luxury. The rooms were old and there were stains all around the…"
422,40,"I stayed here for 2 days connected with an official event. Location is far from the airport and city but transport was arranged so it did not pinch. The property is spacious with plenty of greenery, a good pool, walkways, jogging track and battery operated golf cars for internal movement.  For a 5* rated property, the room offered was small with just the basic facilities, even the tea-coffee maker was hidden and the drinking water was barely sufficient. When asked for drinking water it took a long time by housekeeping to get. Eventhough the room was clean and fresh, it actually requires renovation badly. So is the case with entire property.  Food was good. Breakfast had good variety and was tasty. Buffet lunch was also delicious with punjabi, south-indian veg and non-veg…"

The staff member  from booking counter to the manager level  or from food service  team to the chef  of resort their behaviour is totally appreciable. Regarding the resort can't explain in some sentences , marvellous design, the big pool ,pool bar and all restaurant  are ultimate. Rooms are spacious and with all modern amenities with  Wi fi. The spa , entertaining room and many more all are deserved a 5 star class.i can say the best resort in Bangalore or one of the best property of GP group . highly recommend for team outing or any special day or any kind of functions. Just go and experience this. ..."

425,40,"This resort used to be a fantastic resort with excellent views and a magnificent experience. However, now parts have it have become very run down and are really begging a revamp.   The rooms are still beautiful and pool area etc are beautiful as well but common areas like reception and lobby area around conference room etc has become quite run down. "
426,50,We had been there for our Batch meet #0 years after passing out MBBS from Madras Medical college We all enjoyed the resort so much as we enjoyed our reunion. So peaceful echo friendly resort with such a wonderful pool and garden. Wonderful place for such get together Please visit the link to see my photos https://www.facebook.com/media/set/? set=a.769476786408727.1073741852.100000392392804&type=3.
427,50,"Excellent luxury hospitality experienced @ Golden Palms Hotel & Spa. Had been with my family for a day-outing and all members enjoyed to the core. First, property is well maintained all the time, second options for outdoor & indoor games were many and last but not the least wrt Food spread was awesome.... Two counters for Veg & Non-veg starters which will fill your palate followed by great deserts... main course was not so good, but starters and deserts will not remind you of main course ! ! ! Had been to this place 3 years back and now, they have maintained and improved the quality... Would say that this is the numero one luxury resort to stay, dine, enjoy ! ! ! Thank you team of Golden Palms"
428,40,I stayed here 5 years before...it was a family holiday for 3 nights....the room in which we stayed was quite specious and equipped with all necessary amenities....the buffet in the restaurant was elaborated.... The quality of food was ok...not that great...the resort has been maintained so nice that we never felt to leave that place..swimming pool was big...greenery all over the premises...nicely decorate foyer... Overall good experience... Now after five years there must be lot of changes which must have taken place....definitely visit again
429,40,"This one's definitely the best place to head to while you feel the numbness in your back. It is a massive hotel by scale, huge! And all you can see in the centre is either greenery or water!  A treat for your eyes considering the current globalisation.  Rooms are very spacious and with a personal balcony in every room, works great for couples.  The breakfast here is simply amazing! Maybe it has to do with the view of the large swimming pool while you dine.  The poolside Indian restaurant is a treat to eat at in the night.  Needs little improvement in the service standards, but overall amazing worth for your money!"
430,50,"I stayed here on 5th July on the occasion of my wedding anniversary. The team of hotel has really put in extra efforts to make it special. Nestled in the midst of lush green fields, this resort has numerous collections of bonsai plants, trees and flowers, which makes you feel that you are very closed to nature. Food is good and staffs are quite accommodative to your requests. The Sunday brunch is really nice."
431,30,"We exchanged a week here through Interval International. But they have no clue how to cater to vacation exchange guests because most of their facilities and attention is spent towards corporate parties and weddings.   There are no kitchen facilities even in suites, and no breakfast included for exchange guests. The charges for food are exorbitant. All the sports facilities are filled with the day-use corporate party guests. There is only one clay tennis court filled with rocks and two outdoor badminton courts which is laughable considering windy weather in bangalore. The swimming pool is good sized but has algae all along its walls. No towels are provided at the pool.   Landscaping is the only plus point in this resort which they market very heavily with fancy photos. A lot of…"
432,20,"I stayed here for only one day (glad!) with my family. The service at the hotel was horrible; the staff was impolite and rather inefficient. We had informed them that one of our rooms would need an extra bed but this was only sent to the room around 11:30 pm AFTER we had reminded someone at the front desk and called about four times. As for the food, the quality overall was bad. To begin with, the buffet at Cafe Soltaire was dismal and unhygienic (there were small bugs in the fruits, cheese, breads and desserts). The website incorrectly states, ""you'll find a range of dining options."" The food at Sorrento was acceptable, but over-cooked. The service here was also not good, something my mother and aunt learned when they had to wait 30 minutes for the dessert, only to learn that…"
433,30,"I live in one of the villas Palm Meadows residential area. Today for the first time I got to use the spa facilities. The treatment was very good but the towels which are the same one provided to use as pool towels are stinky.  They needs to address this issue. I use the pool from time to time, not on a regular basis and the towels are always stinky."
434,40,"We had booked around 100 rooms for a corporate event spread over 3 days. The place is away from the city but easily reachable from the airport.  Its a beautiful, well maintained property with a lot of greenery and a fairly large swimming pool. The layout is mainly villa style and the rooms are quite spacious. I had the Director's suite in the main Spa building. The suite is massive and reeks of royalty, however, the bathroom fixtures needed some attention. The food provided for the events was quite good. We had a memorable event and all of us enjoyed our stay at this place."
435,30,"We stayed here just for the sake of locational advantage to BIEC. Thanks to Bangalore traffic status, this hotel can expect to have people who are coming for the events in BIEC. The rooms are spacious but as it is arranged in a villa fashion, the lunch room is too far to opt for. And during the day time, you also do not get the cart to take you off. Therefore, you have to stroll.  Otherwise, the property is very well maintained and can be refreshing for people who are coming to enjoy leisure. the room amenities are good enough, though the bathroom does not have a bath tum and no bath rope is supplied either.  Coming to the food, this is the area that requires attention for improvement. Most of the menus are repeated in buffet and things are not properly managed since continental…"
436,10,"We were a group of around 25 people for a 'Day out' plan. BE CAREFUL when you are enter the resort as vehicular movement is on the right hand side.  Breakfast was good, with lot of varieties which was the only good thing. Lunch had decent spread but not tasty and desert section did not have ice cream. service is also bad, I was fed asking water and later I had to help myself. Swimming pool was the worst part of the resort . I fractured my toe as I slipped due formation of 'green algae' and hit a broken tile. Though the water was shallow, we couldn't see the floor of the pool. shower room were not at all maintained, leaking taps and blocked drainage pipes and slippery floor. I had a sports jersey  and had a argument with the care taker who thinks it's cotton."
437,50,We checked in the hotel by around 10.30 AM. The resort is away from the city which is one of the main advantage. they have lot of area which is suitable for team building activities and the game room is also awesome. and the best thing was the swimming pool which is one of the biggest one I have ever seen swimming costume is must and they are very strict about that
438,40,"We had been to Golden Palms for a team outing. We were a group of around 25 people. Though this place is in the outskirts of Bangalore, it is really a lovely place for team outings. They have an excellent infrastructure and support many activities like Bowling, Archery, Indoor games, Wave pool, Lazy river, etc. The food was also very good. In short our whole team really enjoyed this trip."
439,30,"We stayed one night - April 26th - 5 couples and 2 kids - we had fun ! ( on our own ) Ive been coming here since 2003 or so 10 years - man what a sea change ! ( Clearly Sanjay Khan , Bob Christo your spirit needs to come back !!) Basically a fabulous resort once the playground of bollywood and the rich and famous now run like an average resport only for large corporate gatherings.  Whats wrong ? My personal take and my friends as well - no Passion - zero ! just running on fumes and the past.  1) Restaurant - food was good service pathetic ( do you need to ask for drinking water 7 times !) 2)Pool - Main half closed why ? some issue with the water ( this is peak summer how can that be an excuse??)why did i come ! 3)Rooms - Still good ! some minibars not working cant even cool…"
440,40,"Nice Place for a days corporate outing. We had booked this place before checked-in . We were a team of 20 . We had a lavish breakfast (English /south indian/north indian). The resort provided us a small hall for our activities .After which we played badminton ,tennis and other indoor activities .All this as part of the package . The Lunch again was a wide spread and delicious . After which we played in the pool. Swimming costume is a must.  Overall : A good place"
441,40,"Been here over the weekend and the first thing that struck me were the architectural pieces around the resort. These guys do have a taste for art and gud food. The place is a tad pricey though. But once you reach dere, just forget the world and relax. That's what resorts are for!!"
442,10,"I went along with my family on a day trip here and was extremely disappointed. I was looking for a resort outskirts of Bangalore to getaway from the busy city life and was always interested in Golden palms as its very famous name among other resorts here. The resort has a well maintained garden and pool (pretty big swimming pool), that is it. There is nothing more beyond that. Breakfast and lunch had lot of variety but really no taste. If you go on a day trip like me then you will be shocked to know that there is no place to relax unless if you take rooms. We were just so tired and were sitting in the reception area for most of our time because that was the only place which had cushion chairs to relax. Seriously what were those guys thinking when they furnished this place. They…"
443,40,We had a great experience at the resort with our 6 month old son for 2 nights and three days. We enjoyed the food at the solaire restaurant. It had great variety of food. We loved the desserts and the Italian and Mexican salads the most. The resort has the largest pool and spa..We had a good experience at the spa too. The big lawn in front of our balcony was so refreshing. We met the General Manager Suchita Bhola on d day of our arrival. I must say she is such a lovely host over there among all others.. She always had a smile on her face n my son became very friendly with her and that s coz of her such nice n humble behavior. Other staff at the lobby had hardly smile on their face neither they were moving out of their  desk to greet guests. I always found it was Suchita only who…
444,10,"The place claims to be a 5 star getaway, it hosts marriages when you intend to take a quiet peaceful vacation, the play loud music into the night, terrible service, maintenance is bad, exorbitant prices, old dirty furniture, no cable tv except for a few local kannada channels, in the spa the steam and sauna rooms are dirty the jacuzzi stinks, overall one of the worst places to go unwind after paying such an exorbitant price, very disappointing"
445,20,"This place is just not worth the money. The entire hotel has a very unkempt look, and the service is quite poor. The whole place looks like it were lavish and luxurious during the 90'ies, but have succumbed to apathy of the owners, and neglect of the staff. When we checked into our room, the tap in the bathroom sink was broken, and the mini bar fridge was not working. We demanded a change to an alternate room (which we got, since we had just checked in). In the second room, our troubles were far from over. The air conditioning was not working, so again, we had to call and complain. Now, they definitely addressed our complaints, and sent an electrician to fix this, but supervising repairs on a holiday is a big turn off (if I had to do that, I'd stay at home, thank you very…"
446,30,"The hotel being in proximity to BIEC, I choose to stay here. for 3 nights for my business trip. The hotel by itself is a great nest for nature lovers and holidaying groups. Spread over a vast area, It has a large swimming pool, lust greenery, many restaurants, spa etc.Early morning, you can hear birds chirping though the monkeys can at times be a nuisance especially when they sit next to your door or your balcony. On the other hand, located at a secluded place, there is no travel option except for the travel desk services. The food isn't too great but is on costlier side. Twice, I ordered a non-spicy dish but both times, it was too spicy. The serving staff had nothing to offer except a ""Sorry I told the chef but I dont know why...."". On my business trip again with an option of a…"
447,10,When we arrived there were no refreshments and to top it all of the staff was horrible we had gone there with two kids and two adults so when I went to check in the staff asked my wife for her id proof we had not got it so this man told us to go back over all experience was horrible the rooms were tiny the front appear emcee was good but as they say don't judge a book by its cover 
448,40,Stayed at Golden Palm for 2 nights as part of corporate offsite. There were not much of guests at resort except for our group (good for us). Resort is nice and spacious; Room are also equally spacious though little out-dated. Food quality needs improvement. Pool is very big and tempting. Overall would recommend for once in a while weekend kinda stay.
449,10,"A long, dusty, pot holed driveway suggests you have taken a wrong turning until you arrive at a heavily padlocked gate. A sleepy security guard unfortunately let us in. Shabby gardens, paths and a disorganized layout didn't provide much hope for the prospects of a decent room. Alas, a faulty TV, an empty fridge, old and worn towels had us plotting an early escape. Overlooking the scraggly balcony we spotted a glimmer of hope - quite a few staff. Maybe a good bar and lots of good service could get us through....alas....the bars were disorganized and staffed by lots of differ levels of staff wearing different outfits - I assumed some were more advanced than others and hence stood on the side doing.....well....not a lot really. The actual workers looked like they were all first day…"
450,20,"was at Golden Palms for an official offsite meeting for 4D/3N. the property is still well maintained, but the same can't the said for the food. Also our check-in took a good 40mins and we were only 30 people.   The good thing was the rooms open directly into the garden so you can enjoy the mornings in the garden, but beware of the falling coconuts :)"
451,30,"I spent there a 3 days business convention. Occupation is mostly business as the facility is appropriate for this kind of event. Lot of space, huge pool (too big?) and large and comfortable rooms. The indian buffet was very complete. Nice tropical gardens with monkeys and so on. But the place is too big to be well maintained I guess. To go to my room I did need to ask for a cart ride. Also one thing I cannot understand: when the staff makes up the room during the day, they turn on all the room lights. I had a suite and when I came to my room about 15 lights were on! Where is the basic good sense of saving energy? I tried the spa and was not impressed.  My first night the aircon did not make cold. I could not pay my stay with any of my visa cards (rejected).  Staff was overall…"
452,40,Great place to have a short family vacation. I've been here thrice. I love to have SPA here. though it's quite far from the airport if somebody is not from Bangalore but a worth stay. Having a cup of coffee or a drink along with your date or spouse or friends gives you great relaxation. staff is very friendly. explore multi cuisine buffet for mouth watering fish and prawns.   overall a good resort.
453,40,The resort is away fro the traffic and noise of the city and is really spacious. The rooms open up directly into the garden. The restaurant has a good menu when it comes Indian cuisines. A good place for company team building activities and picnics. The conference rooms are good for day long seminars.
454,40,Avery good place to spend the weekend. The spa was amazing. Had a great weekend. The Food was quite average thou. But i feel in love with the place. Peaceful quite and real weekend getaway . The rooms have a gr8 view.
455,20,"This is not a ""luxury"" resort by any stretch of imagination. We went on a weekend for a ""Day-out"" package. The front desk is very standoff-ish. The wait and service staff not very pleasant or helpful. If you need you have anything you have to chase the wait staff repeatedly. The lunch buffet was adequate and had a bit of variety. The buffet was a little un-organized and chaotic. e.g had to remind service staff for service spoons etc.   The package included lunch and afternoon ""tea"". The tea was unorganized too. The tea/coffee not was not planned or estimated properly. The wait staff was unwilling to replenish or refill coffee/tea service for new guests.   Their claim to fame supposedly is the Spa facilities. The reservation is entirely manual and you have chase the front desk…"
456,40,A very good outing resort in Bangalore which is hardly 20km from the Bangalore city. The food isnt that great. But the place is worth a visit to every Bangalorean and others. The rooms are pretty big but has to be maintained well by the management.
457,40,"We had an offsite here earlier this month, and I was pleasantly surprised to see the resort almost full, even though it was during the weekdays. Lot of space, verdant grounds, a nice pool - all exude a relaxed charm complemented by good food, albeit with a spicy touch (which i personally liked)"
458,40,"I went there with my 2 friends and stayed 2 nights.. We really enjoyed the dinner and breakfast. We also enjoyed using the gym,indoor games . This hotel is best for weekend outing, swimming pool is awesome, Clean, One of the big i ever enjoyed....The place is very well maintained,The rooms were clean, spacious..service was average, not much personal care.. A very nice theme and very well maintained resort designed for weekend outings."
459,10,"Not well maintained and we did not get any attention from anybody. We have waited around 20 minutes in the reception to get in and none of the staff was friendly to approach. Need to improve a lot, i can't recommend this hotel to anybody. Road to hotel is horrible to travel."
460,50,"I visited the Golden Palms Hotel and Spa on the 8th of Feb accompanied by colleagues for a team day outing.  The facilities at the resort were nowhere short of excellent, and the food was exceptionally good - as good as any food I have tasted across the best of Bangalore restaurants. We had members of all ages (some colleagues brought their kids along), and with different food habits, and everybody loved the assortment available.  The swimming pool is a delight with the staff being extremely friendly and happy to offer a water-ball to allow us to play in the pool.  Overall, I would rate the resort, the staff, food, and the facilities with the best in class in Bangalore.  Thanks for making the outing so good!"
461,50,"Me, my wife and our little daughter spent the weekend here and were pleasantly surprised by the upgrade of our room from deluxe to suite. Though this can happen to many of us, we enjoyed the place very well. Lot of options for breakfast, plenty of greenery! I learnt that a lot of weddings happen here and in 2 days we saw 2 weddings happening and we thought some day we can get our daughter married in a place like this!!!  Summary is a great weekend getaway for Bangaloreans! But watch out the road leading to the property is bad like any other Bangalore roads!"
462,30,"I have been to a marriage function at Golden Palms. It is a big property with an enormous pool. Greenery is too good but at places I found glitches in maintenance at places. Food was not very good....it was ok. Spa was good and maintained. Like I read other trip advisior reviews for this place stating that staff is rude but on the contrary I found staff friendly. Overall, I had expected a lot from this place but I found it to be an average resort. Not recommended for holiday people."
463,50,"We have visited this place as a part of my office outing.   The Swimming pool experience was awesome. The food was superb. It had   the facilities of cricket ground,  table tennis, badminton etc. All my colleagues really loved the place and I highly recommend it.  PS: It is owned by Hrithik Roshan."
464,10,"3 days back me and my colleague been to this property as a part of my company res conference. starting from reception i got very bad experience, no care has been given to us, looks like nobody knows what they are doing at lobby,no welcome drinks and even the manager is busy on the phone always,food was reasonably good. worst part is room was smelling and corridor was literally stinking. we never expected these type of standard from a 5 star hotel. my sincere advise to all corporate colleagues to avoid this resort, same place was taken care well when we visited 4 years back, now none of the staffs are good and they are least bothered for guests."
465,20,Stayed here in December 2013. Resort looks really nice in the pictures. Looks are deceptive. Staff at reception some of the worst. No idea what hospitality means. Hardly bothered about the guests. Most of the staff at the resort were new and hardly understand English. rooms were decent. food was ok.  Will never visit this place again.
466,50,"THe golden palms hotel outside of banglore is perfect for a weekend get away from the noisy and pollution of the city. With a nice swimming pool, varios restaurants and bars catering to various tastes, the royal palms offers the perfect weekend getaway."
467,40,"Stayed for a night with my family, rooms were in very good order and clean, highlight of the resort is the swimming pool and it is clean,well maintained and safe for kids to use, however I saw the lifeguard sending away customers who did not have the right swim wear, so do remember to carry your swim wear. Food was excellent and service was pukka, overall ambiance was good and my family enjoyed the stay. They are many activities like cycling, snooker,squash with which you could keep the kids busy. All in all we had a good time and would recommend it to others to try."
468,20,"The Golden Palms Hotel & Spa welcomes you with grand reception lobby. Further inside, the property looks amazing. However, the problems start from the reception desk where the front desk people are completely incompetent. They do not understand basics of hospitality. I have faced innumerable problems while check-in for myself as well as the guests whom I had invited on behalf of my company. Further more, after checking into a room, that same room was given to another guest who entered my room while we had occupied it. And the front desk could not explain this horrible mistake."
469,40,"My tour of Bangalore for four days along with my two freind in the month of Dec. 2013,  was memorable. The resort is nice,very comfortable with lot of green surrounding and away from city noise and pollution.The morning walk is refreshing and the track for walking is really good.The rooms are decent and clean.It is advisable to prefer first floor room for better use of room balcony and for nice pool view .The pool is very big size and very clean.The complimentry breakfast is nice,the food is good but overpriced. Be aware of monkey and falling Coconut in the garden.The door in the balcony will automatically lock if you close it, so be careful.  Resort is good for family vacation. The only negative point is the 45 km. distance from the city."
470,40,"I recent visited Bangalore on Business and decided to stay at Golden Palms for a change. It turned out to be a welcome change. A shift from the usual typical Hotel room with just a window to view a pool-side or a roadside. But here I found all the rooms opening on to a Balcony facing the central Landscape which is beautifully created & excellently maintained. However fatigued you may be, but once you reach there, it's all gone. Not to miss the walking/ jogging track that invites you to get fresh before you start your day. Amazing Experience!"
471,50,"very comfortable and luxurious. (at affordable price)  giant swimming pool. gymnasium with sauna and steam, sports centre with billiards and tennis. property is huge and morning walk is refreshing. I liked the ambience and freshness. only negative: the distance from city."
472,30,The resort is nice the problem with this place is to get to this place is very tricky. The rooms are decent and they have lovely pool. The room service and food served in the restaurant is overpriced and they really need to rework on them. The food served pretty ordinary. In short there are better options near Bangalore for a better price. Before i forget the resort has a monkey problem which they need to address as they can be a problem with kids around or if you have left any food in your balcony.
473,50,"Its being a great Opportunity to serve my client at GOLDEN PALMS Bangalore. Front office in the guidance of Mr. Sanjeev & Lobby Manager Mr Somu is very efficient. Banquet Service quality is excellent. Hotels is nicely cleaned, menu was good, CHEF's were very comfortable in changing the menu in a very short span of time as per client request.  BEST PLACE for Weekends also .......  Regards  Prince Pandey  Business Development Head : MACHIS"
474,50,"We had visited this resort for our business conference. We stayed there for 2 days. This resort is little far from the city but its an amazing resort..Mr. Debashish Mohanty was the contact person for us and he was really very helpful and supportive. The ambiance of the resort is just wonderfull.. its a very big property with a lot of amenities. They have all categories of rooms..very elegant, beautiful and specious..It has one of the largest swimming pools which is just amazing..They have three very good restaurants with really good food..Along with that they have fabulous Spa services..One will really enjoy the walk here as the resort is full of greenery and freshness..they have nice bar also where we had our cocktail party.. overall the stay was really pleasant.. I would…"
475,10,"We had been to this resort for team outing.They have an awesome huge swimming pool.We had a very bad experience there.  We were group of girls who wanted to swim in the pool. We had put on our nylon clothes and went near the pool to have a cool dip.The pool keeper did not allow us to enter the pool,instead he was very rude and asked to wear swimming costume (I don't know whether he meant a bikini or shorts,we were wearing nylon clothes which were comfortable to us).      We got back and changed to normal clothes and thought to just dip our feet in the water.The same pool keepers came to us asked us ""is it a lake to dip ur legs here,remove it.You are not the only set of ppl I should gaurd "".     We felt very bad and that was such a rude behavior and not a way to speak to guests…"
476,40,"I visited Golden Palm resort in December 2013 with friends for a day out and had a memorable experience.  The resort provides loads of activities both indoor and outdoor which are well maintained. It also a very large swimming pool. Breakfast was awesome, lunch was good but had to wait for sometime before we could get a table for a large group. Overall a good place for a day outing."
477,30,The property is situated almost 1 hr. from the airport. It is an oasis of greenery. The landscaping is really good. Has various categories of rooms. My stay there from 4th Dec to 7th Dec 2013 was in connection to a conference. It has one of the largest swimming pools that I have seen in my stay at various hotels. The restaurants (three of them) serve decent food. My experience with the room service was bad. The food served was not hot & took almost double the time that was promised. The fitness freaks would have very good time - as they have a jogging track of almost 800 mtrs. and with very good plantation all over the property it is fun to take your morning walk.
478,40,"I stayed in this resort on a business trip from 20th Nov to 23rd nov 2013. The resort is really well build and peaceful. The sweaming pool is excellent and large. The pool side restaurant is good and so the barbeque bar which gets laid every night. The area is so large that it takes a long walk to reach from one spot to the other. The service becomes slow, mainly because  of the distance the staff has to travel once they are called. But an excellent place to unwind for a family, may not be a suitable place for a business stop over."
479,40,"We had gone to Golden Palms for a friend's wedding. Our stay was pleasant and the place was truly breathtaking. It's like a city of its own and away from the hustle bustle. Golden Palms provides comfort and luxury to its residents.   They should increase the transportation available so it is easier to take people around the entire resort. The food and rooms were top notch, no complaints there."
480,50,"My wife & I had become a member of this hotel & had been to the hotel on 16th November 2013 for a stay.Though we had some difficulty in locating the hotel,once we reached there we had very pleasant time there.The hotel has a big swimming pool which is well maintained & all the rooms are having balconies giving a grand view of the pool & other surroundings.The hotel located in well spread out area which was also well maintained was really rejuvenating.The food served was good & the service was also excellent.We also used the spa facilities & had a relaxing massage with steam bath.It was really a time well spent &was soothing &relaxing.."
481,40,"Golden Palms Resort & Spa is a Township in itself. Excellent Scenic beauty inside with a jogging track, 3 restaurants, convention centers and above all spa..!!  Very good gym and delicious food. The employees are also very helpful."
482,40,"I had been staying here regularly for last 3 years & have found the quality & value provided has improved significantly. They provide a personalized touch in their services that gives us a homely feeling.  Hospitality is magnanimous & staff is very friendly, courteous & caring to take care of your little needs even. The environment is very serene, calm & quiet to relieve all your stress. Greenary, one of the biggest swimming pool, spa, very big gym, lightening, indoor & outdoor sports facility, enough space to carry all sort of activities are some of its salient features which makes it different. Food is also very good & can be requested to alter it as per your taste & requirements.  atserved for full 17 days conducting a training program"
483,50,"I had an amazing experience having been to Golden Palms Hotel, Service staff are too good..! Its a huge property with pleasant environment. Food is amazing..! Great in terms of Hospitality..!! Over all an excellent choice for short or long stay/  Parties & Dayouts..!!!"
484,40,"Located at the outskirts of Bangalore off Bangalore - Tumkur highway is a nice resort with very good ambience lots of greenery but the problem is their service their staff seems to be under-trained either they don't know how to serve you or they over do it by trying to be over courteous specially the bell boys and the room service, their front office staff not worth mentioning - their response is very cold. We were 4 colleagues and were given rooms in different & opposite locations, going by the size of this resort it would take atleast 10 mins to walk to the other room (they have battery operated golf cart to ferry you around which generally don't come on time). Food taste and quality is good but service at the restaurant is very bad and too slow. The swimming pool is big…"
485,50,"Nice swimming pool. - Excellent food. Bar and Restaurants are good with variety of food, especially open buffet. We were on business trip with 3 Auditors and got time in eve for SPA. Enjoyed a lot spending time there. Has good open space. Staff is very helpful. Good surrounding with lot of space for Morning walk. Gym is good. Take Sports Shoes along and swimming costume is must."
486,40,"Location:  a bit far away from the city. Takes 1.5 to 2 hours from the airport by road and there is nothing around. So if you are planning to go to the city/Shop/Sightseeing, this is not the place for you.   Resort: Spread over 15/19 Acres, it’s a green oasis. Beautifully manicured gardens make it ideal place to roam around. Take a ride in their golf cart around or walk/jog on the jogging track.  Biggest drawback: no signs to direct you around the property. Gets confusing and a bit frustrating. This needs to be addressed at the earliest.  Service: Minus points on this score. No one will guide you or inform you about the resort. One of the restaurants was closed but were not informed till reached there for dinner. Just not done. Else, the staff was helpful. However, some of the…"
487,40,"A bit far away from the airport, with not so good road condition.  Especially the approach road to the resort which is a stretch of approximately 5-6 kms is not too great experience - without street lights it becomes a bit scary to travel at night.  On entering the resort, you see the touch of luxury & exploring the lush green resort in those little golf cars is an experience in itself. The resort was earlier owned by Sanjay Khan & he hosted the wedding of Hrithik Roshan & Susane in the same resort.  So one can imagine its standards, though now the owners have changed. A resort with wonderful spa facilities, great to hold conferences for corporate & plenty of options for food with choices of Indian, Chinese, Italian & a barbeque at the pool side.  Overall a fantastic experience,…"
488,40,"We recently went here for a 3-day stay as part of our office outing and had a really wonderful time.  Pluses: - Nice swimming pool. - Excellent food, The resort also took care of my special dietary request (for Jain food). Mr. Marem (Asst. Manager) personally ensured that I got fresh, piping-hot food everyday. - Quiet rooms and good games.  Negatives: - Number of outdoor activities are fewer (because of limited land) - The DJ in the DJ night was ok, he kept repeating same songs.  However, overall it was a wonderful resort and we had a gala time."
489,20,"We were around 70 odd people @ this pathetic resort on 23oct2013. From the word go, there were no staff to guide us. One security guard told us to only enter one floor where breakfast was served. Breakfast Menu was average. Entering swimming pool , there came some trainers again who were always blocking us from playing or even cheering each other.  Lunch was mere tragedy... Rotis were cold, no starters...ice cream..plain vanilla..overall old sliding place. Staff need some human training. Chef needs to lift the food value. Highly Not recommended."
490,50,"Near Bangalore, but away from the crowd, It is a wonderful place to conduct reviews & meetings or to jump in for a day out. We completed our Annual Meeting recently at the venue. The arrangements were just fantastic. The 225+ delegates loved the experience. The conference halls, rooms, food arrangements not only met, but exceeded expectations. The staff are very courteous & ensure the guests are not let down for any wants. The greatest attraction is the food, which is fabulous, authentic & ensures people come back for many more, My personal vote goes for the biggest attraction in food the Veg Biryani prepared by the chefs. Try out various cuisines prepared, if in a group ask for North Karnataka / Chettinad!!"
491,10,We had a bad experience. We as a group came to visit this place as a team outing. The food arrangements are horrible.Most of the people in my team started shouting at us to arrange the outing at this place because of the food .I can even hear some of my team member saying Ice cream is the only food that has good taste.And before we enter pool we got instructed from the staff not to shout are roam around in lobby.That is ridiculous.How can we have fun without shouting and laughing.Next time i will make sure that from my company nobody will select this place for outing.
492,50,"Away from the hustle bustle of the bangalore city, this place is very peaceful to be at. I have visited Golden Palms many times and thus this review is long pending.  This is a must visit place for Business or Pleasure. The huge property give you enough to easily spend couple of days exploring. The restaurants serve fantastic Food. Chef's here are very kind to look at guest's preference. Hospitality of the people working here is also admirable.  I will recommend this place to everyone."
493,40,This hotel/spa is a really fantastic place to hang out with friends/family. located in a nice location out of the city and is a ideal place to unwind. Food is awesome and the hotel has got a awesome pool with great spa!! Definitely will visit again to unwind!!! :)
494,50,"Excellent food and service, talk about indian or Chinese.  The staff is prompt and very helpful, the place was very well maintained.  Try the prawns and lamb at Hidden Dragon, ask the chef to recommend their speciality.  Spa - We engaged ourselves in a holistic back, face and scalp therapy again Somesh was at his best."
495,50,"This hotel is fantastic. The staff are very accommodating and extremely pleasant. A great place to stay to unwind or to bring a group on business.  Only one issue...the rooms, due to their construction can be quite noisy,"
496,50,Awesome service and and Excellent Ambiance.. had a wonderful time with the family.. a little far from the city but worth the travel and the staff is really friendly.. will definitely visit again.. the hotels restaurants are great.. the food is awesome... A very Beautiful pool which is Asia's largest..
497,40,What a master piece.... had a lovely stay n a gud time of my life with my friends ......will visit the hotel soon again..... the swimmin pool is superb ... so widely spread.... good services provided.... a must visit property...
498,50,"Date: 26-09-13 I guess this is one of the top resorts in india, We booked suit room which was very spacious with all amenities, spacious balconies.Buffet was excellent.A very big swimming pool and a 3 storied spa  very well maintained had an experience that has left a lasting impression  even after returning home!!"
499,50,"we came to hotel through a residential conference. we stayed one day however we enjoyed maximum.When we entered the hotel we got received with lots of smiling faces at reception especially the manager at front, good job. Entire conference was well done , i really enjoyed the swimming pool and the hospitlaity of staff of Golden palms.I will come back with my family soon, good job keep it up"
500,40,"This one is ideal for a short weekend holiday in Bangalore. The resort has good rooms, service and package deals for weekends. They have good steam and Spa centre which is complementary with stay. Food is good and one really enjoys in a quiet ambience."
501,40,"we visited Golden Palms last weekend for our team outing. The place is bit inside the main road and with the current rain the joining road is in bad shape. The resort itself is beautifully maintained. we opted for breakfast-lunch and tea package, and intended to indulge the day in playing, it turned out to be a great visit. The cricket ground is opposite to the venue, it is a small ground apt for a tennis ball cricket. The pool is huge, and has separate kids and adult section. A bar by the pool side is a good touch. One interesting info: we found that the drink cost varies in the resort depending upon where you buy it, the indoor games area being a touch lesser in cost."
502,40,"It was one of the finest hotels I have been to. Beautiful property and huge well kept as well. Very helpful staff. But the food is too expensive and is far away from the city as well as from the main road. Approach to this hotel is really bad. But once you are in you'll forget everything. Spa and sauna are the best in the country as well as the swimming pool. Good place to spend with your family away from all the noise and pollution and very close to the nature. Elixir air, lovely Bangalore weather and peaceful surrounding. Food taste I would say 7/10 and quantity also not that sufficient."
503,50,It was great stay at golden palm resorts. Room(suite) was spacious with all amenities and maintained very classy. Staff were very friendly and courteous. We enjoyed the food in both restaurants(except Italian).Food was great and buffet was value for money. Swimming pool and spa is very nice. Great place to have fun.......
504,40,"We went to Golden Palms Resort for our offsite Team Meeting. The Resort is located on outskirts of Bangalore and is spread over 30 Acres of very green area. The rooms are spacious, comfortable and well furnished. The quality of service is excellent.  They have a very nice Gym and 800m long walking track amidst trees, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  Most relevant is that the all-inclusive price we got was very good indeed. Real value for money. No negatives come to my mind for my two days' stay."
505,50,"We booked this hotel for our weekend stay.our decision was correct....the hotel was neat and clean...food was very good in cafe solaire...lots of variety...in breakfast, lunch and dinner...like ...5-6 types of salads...3-4 types of pasta and noodles...then papdi chaat, soups and ..7-8 types of vegetables..but best one was deserts...sweets..cakes was very good... but i will give one suggestion...in our 2 days stay...in this ice cream was missing...my son is fond of ice cream...if we'll go out and he don't get ice cream .. for him it means... jyada maja nahi aaya...so plz add ice cream also...so that next time he'll be satisfied.  pool was neat and clean.... there is nothing wrong with the facilities. The room we had was spacious and pretty.....  overall value for money...  pooja…"
506,10,"I had travelled from a very long distance in the middle of the night along with a bunch of friends. We decided to relax and sip some coffee at this very place. On reaching the place we were taken back.Pathetic response from the establishment. The secutiry guards did not even allow us inside the gate.When I spoke to the person inside from the security office via phone the respoise was awful.  A person from their front office ended up at the gate to inform us that the entire venue was booked for a wedding.If this was the case the case the management should have been more responsible enough to put up a PUBLIC-NOTICE, informing people about the closure of the Resort to the regular guests.  I would conclude, anyone visiting this unreasonable, pathetic service and ill treated…"
507,10,"We had a very bad experience. The staff and the security guards were very rude. All that we  asked was to serve us some coffee. we had traveled a long distance and wanted to relax for a bit. But unfortunately they dint allow us inside the property citing that the place has been completely booked and the kitchen is not available for outside guests. Their front office executive Mr. Atanu instead referred us to another hotel close by.   If we had to visit another hotel close by, why would we even put an effort to travel that distance. then we landed up in Taj Vivanta, really appreciate their service and hospitality.  We have made up our mind that we will never go back to Golden Palms. Its really sad that a property as large as this, which was known for its hospitality has lost all…"
508,10,"We ordered the hotel because it looks very nice. The pool and the bars, the restaurants, the whole location was and looks like a very nice experience and absolutely good for relaxation.  BIG MISTAKE. The hotel just looks in this way. The rooms are dirty and not very comfortable. The carpets are dirty and old. The most incredible was the service in all the hotel. Wherever you go, bar, restaurant, room service, etc. we never experienced such a lousy service.  The hotel has an Italian Restaurant. We waited exactly 1.5 hours for our order. And it still was not to what we expected. The result was, that we had a deep discussion with the Management, who tried to change several things which we complained. They failed.  This hotel is only recommendable when you need a close location to…"
509,10,"This place is off a very busy Tumkur highway.  The road, aptly christened Golden Palms Avenue, is a nightmare, filled with potholes.  The resort itself is filled with plants and trees.  That is perhaps the only redeeming feature.  Our room and many others, have theme driven decor.  Now coming to the issues.  Our toilet flush drained water, the whole night and refused to shut down.  Our toilet seat came off.  The resort food was soggy and oily.  The sports facilities were basic and they insisted on charging for badminton shuttles, a practice that seemed out of place given the tariffs that one coughs up.  The spa, was the only functional element in the entire resort.  The steam bath worked.  The masseur was OK. I guess this resort has gone downhill since the ownership moved from a…"
510,40,"The hotel has a decent outdoor space and the rooms are beautifully surrounding the swimming pool Area. It has one of the largest swimming pools I have seen surrounded by a beautiful landscape. Rooms are quite comfortable with all amenities. Thought I feel hotel should have a faster room service. We used the conference room for our meeting, its decently big and has all the facilities. although the lift which leads to the top floor conference room is small for a crowded big gathering. While walking in the open area we should be careful of falling coconuts. One should not miss to try the tasty Awadhi Biryani at the bar and resturant at poolside."
511,40,"It was just about the end of winter when we stayed at this resort for a couple of days. The property is quite large and well maintained. Rooms are also lavish and well attended to. The food is not that great and could be much better. The main focus of the resort used be the spa. However now it is mainly business conferences, weddings and day picnics. The one big thing missing is a child's play area in the entire property and thats quite surprising."
512,40,We had a short (2 nights only) stay in this place. Enjoyed the pool and the poolside bar! The Breakfast spread is good and so is the general quality of restaurant food. Excellent Gym and Spa facilities.
513,20,"We had a company outing from Dell on 23rd July and we were surprised during lunch when we found out that there is no starters. In the non-veg section we only had Fish moily very badly prepared tasted like fish floating in turmeric water and some tasteless chicken gravy. The only item palatable was the curd rice. For Rs.950 it was a total dud, please don't go there without confirming the menu as they will take you for a ride."
514,30,"we exchanged via interval international into this resort from 12-19july 2013 and i need to say that while the service is excellent and the complimentary fruit, biscuits and choclate are a nice touch, i would not stay at this hotel again and this is why: it is overrun by corporate event, which are very noisy and have parties until very late.  we recorded 80 decibel in the room on wednesday after a long day out.  but more importantly, this resort is in the middle of absolutely nowhere and is at best a corporate retreat, rather than a gateway to experience india.  while you can hire a driver for the day at 2500rupee (tourist rate) for 80km and 8 hours, you will really need to do your homework and plan ahead to get the best out of this service.  but more importantly, is the fact…"
515,40,I went to this place with 100 colleagues of my company for 2 days conference. I checked in there on 12th July and checked out on 14th July. My stay there was very very good. I stayed in room no 181 which is close to the swimming pool on the ground floor. The rooms there are spacious with LED TV and very well lighted. The toilets are well maintained and the toilet accessories were of good quality. The breakfast had very large spread and the sitting areas are very relaxing by the side of the pool or facing the garden. The lunch and dinner have again wide choice of menu and you would definitely like the taste. The hotel people are very helpful and quite fast in offering you the service. The conference facilites are good and each room is fitted with Wifi and good sound system. Their…
516,20,"This is my second stay in Golden Palm. This property has more than 150+ rooms. Property is showing signs of aging though room interiors are painted. This  is preferred location to host events for Corporate s  as property has more number rooms compared to others resorts around Bangalore. This has it’s own disadvantages for the other guests who want spend quite week end. Avoid this place on weekends as many IT companies do day outing. I had seen atleast 4-5 companies on hosting events (outdoor events & as well as seminars )They do outdoor activity with mike which disturbs other people. You feel as though you are in market. Last time, I was allotted room on corner of property where trucks came for loading /unloading, I could not sleep properly. I have yell to those truck people…"
517,10,"I have been to his place for multiple office outing. For complete day activity we pay lots of money to these guys and what we get in turn is horrible experience of standing in queue for each and every activity. They never say for booking for a particular day even if it is 13-15th group for same day.  they have very limited facility and hardly care about experience of customer. For a team outing, if i need to wait for 1 hr to play badminton or fuzzball, nothing can be irritated than this. They should have common sense of inviting limited groups with their limited facilities. Although food is good here, I will hardly suggest this place to anyone for outing. because food is not  what makes my day. We were not able to find any place to sit and relax even. it was so crowded like a…"
518,40,"I spent a whole week at this place for a residential program. this was my second visit to this place, the earlier one being almost 8 years ago. the place has been maintained very well. it is clean and the staff are very courteous. the restaurant had a good spread for breakfast as well as dinner. the pool was hardly used. over the weekend, saw families also visiting and spending the day here. overall, i would recommend this place for a peaceful getaway, that is close to the city."
519,50,"We happened to visit Golden Palms in short notice, it was just a casual team get together while I was at Intel. We all just took a long drive to and had a pleasant day. It was written on boards as this resort has Asia's Biggest Swimming Pool not sure about the fact but this pool is huge and big. I am a average swimmer but couldn't complete one full stretch in single go. Food is average but Spa is awesome. After 4-5 hours of swim I got nice SPA (complete body) and nice dinner. When returned to bed it was too relaxing. Far away from the city limits but worth a drive."
520,30,"At first glance this is a great place, but once you stay there the problems show up. For a start, it rained and getting from the room to the reception meant a hell-for-leather run. The umbrellas were conspicuous by their absence. Of course, you could call the reception and ask for one of those buggies, but it takes time  The room is large, but not cosy, and somewhat unfriendly. The bathroom shower will test your engineering skills to get the right temperature  the cupboards are musty, and the television temperamental  Above all the breakfast buffet was quite ordinary, after my morning jog, I was ravenous. Of course I learnt the conventional Bangalore sambar was different from the Madras sambar, although none of the waiters present could tell me the exact difference between the…"
521,40,"One of the best resorts. Have visited in india. Awesome property with even more better managers and staff. Very very helpful in averything. Had gone for a wedding to which was hosted in the resort. It was as smooth as silk.  The total credit goes to the management team. Bosses and owners, on the other hand dont seem to care about the property anymore. Pool was dirty, most rooms need renovation, paint thoroughly required.  Food was also avg but was compesnsated with the friendliness and comfort provided by the people there.  Management... Keep it up Owners... Get a grip. U have an excellent property. Maintain it."
522,50,Golden palms ..The name truely goes with the hotel ....Got to expierence a business trip here for 3 days ...but recommended for a vacation with family or friends ...we cannot enjoy much with our office collegues ...Located off tumkur ..almost outside the city about 25-30 kms ...you have to take care if you are going at the night when you turn from the tumkur road ..its deep inside almost 6 - 7 kms from main road(tumkur road) ....comes a lovely place ..which you have not imagined that can be sooo..beautiful ...from gardens(beware of the coconuts falling ) to swimming pool ...restaurants ...bars ..conference rooms ...everything is beautiful and perfect ...dint get much time to expierence ..but had an excellent food anytime of the day ....All rooms are almost the same and are quiet…
523,40,I had great apprehensions before getting here because of some of the negative reviews. I wrote an email to the hotel to which the GM responded and put me to ease. The hotel & rooms seem renovated... very spacious rooms & bathroom with a lovely big Balcony outside.  The pool is massive & the night i arrived it did seem very dirty but the morning after - we saw it getting cleaned & was clear as ever. Staff were very efficient & quick to respond. Food was average in taste but the hotel did their best & it was the most pleasant stay i had!
524,50,"Was in their property for a day last month. Service was awesome and staff is excellent. The food at coffee house is delicious and buffet is wide spread.  They had extra activities for kids like water zorbing, tatoo etc all for free.  Overall I truly enjoyed the wonderful experience."
525,50,We had booked the resort for my sisters wedding. All our guests were really happy with the services & amenities of the resort. We got more than what we were promised.   The food in the banquets was particularly very good unlike other hotels who mess us food during banquets.   The hotel has really cooperative staff who accommodated all requests during the wedding. It was home away from home.    Overall a very enjoyable experience.
526,40,"Good services and activities. arrangements made were perfect and the lawn area is good for cricket. The pool is very big and in spite of 300 people being there, we had enough area to swim and play.  Rooms are a bit over priced. Food is good and THE STAFF IS FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL."
527,30,"Not a good value for your money.  The approach road is bad, lot of pot holes.  Not sophisticated and you can clearly see the difference between the leading chains like Taj and Oberoi.    The food is quite expensive for what they serve.  The Italian restaurant is a joke.  I would get a better pizza on small road side places than here.    Pool is big but I found a wire hanging from a light inside the pool.  The pool chairs are not properly organized and not much help around.    Rooms are good but AC doesn't have control.  Barthrooms are good.  Overall, not a good value and at this price you can get much better hotels and service."
528,30,"This is my 4th time to this resort. This time on a weekend trip with family and friends. All the fountains were not operational or not switched on. Spa was empty and we didn't see anyone in the spa. AC was not switched on and pretty hot in the spa area. They have very big lagoon swimming pool , One of the swimming pool areas was under cleaning and waterfall near the pool area was not on.   Overall we didn't get the good resort feel due to non operation of fountains and other water bodies. Pretty ordinary experience.   I recommend to check with the hotel whether they have everything operational before you make a booking."
529,40,"My husband and i had been to the Golden Palms Hotel & Spa for a night stay.We thoroughly enjoyed our stay there. This was our second visit to the resort after 3 years. The place has regular maintenance. Our room was good equipped with all the facilities. Assistance of any sort was provided quickly. We had a lot of choice to spend our time from indoor/outdoor activities to using steam,sauna and the swimming pool. The best thing about the resort is its great buffet spread and delicious food. We had a relaxed weekend. Its a great place to unwind."
530,40,"Was at Golden Palms last Sunday for lunch with the family . Must appreciate the attentive and courteous service especially from Krishnan and Nelson. They were outstanding . Vivek Joshi , the F & B Manager , was all over the place ensuring things were under control. The food spread was good and the quality noteworthy - Kudos to Chef Francis and his Team . Will be back !"
531,30,"I rememeber going to this place 4 years ago and that is what made me consider this place again for a team outbound.However was very dissapointed with everything .The quality of rooms (bathrooms knobs fallings ,walls were chipped ,smell of not being used for some time ) was very average.Good pool for kids to unwind . Spa was not welll maintained and parlour is non functional. (specially for the knd of money they charge).All i experienced was an average experience in comparison to my earlier visit.I guess lot to do with the new management.I believe no longer managed by the Khans."
532,40,"We like the hotel, stayed there twice, the upstairs rooms are preferable. We found it an excellent place to unwind after a long flight and a long trip around south India. The grounds are delightful, staff attentive, food good, just a long where from anywhere. But that has its advantages."
533,50,"An excellent resort and spa with the best staff ever.  They respnded to our every needs immediately.  The pool is incredible, and the rooms nice and clean.The restaurants served incredible food, and the prices for food and drink were very reasonable.  The lush gardens are just beautiful."
534,50,"1hr from city....good getaway with family...kids love the pool and wow what a pool....squas, tt, water  volley ball....all interesting ways to spend time. the bar isnt as well staffed and we found it tough to walk wet to the counter.....and u expect more tables with umbrellas specially on a scorching hot day.... the lunch buffet was huge....however u'd expect more than just buscuits with evening tea.... the variety of restaurants at such a far flung out place dazes me!"
535,40,"My stay was for 3 days at the resort for an official conference. Here is my experience:  Location: Good - not very far off from the city. The area is quiet and calm. Roads are good enough to take your car there - no issues on that front. It is around 3 Kms off Tumkur Road and very close to Bangalore International Exhibition Center (BIEC)  Parking facility: Huge space available for parking within the resort. A big plus on this. Security round the clock to keep an eye on.  Check-in / Check-out process: did not take more than 5 mins each. pretty fast here  Reception area is large and ample space to sit and wait, if you really need to.  Rooms: We stayed in the twin luxury room - spacious and feels fresh. Furniture, linen and bath were clean and well maintained. All rooms have a sit…"
536,50,"Golden Palms is a 5 star deluxe hotel spread out in 14 acres of green land. I stayed here for 3 days to attend our company's conference. it's an ideal place to conduct meetings, conferences and to relax with family and friends. This hotel has 135 luxurious rooms, 16 suites & 2 presidential suites. Rooms are clean and tidy & maintained well. walking through the lanes you will find the freshness of dense foliage & lush greenery. Delicious food is served and new varieties are included in the breakfast each day. Swimming pool is absolutely fantastic. Good staff. Overall a good experience."
537,40,"To celebrate our wedding Anniversary my Husband planned a day trip to Golden Palms Resort for us. This was a surprise for me. We reached just around lunch. We were welcomed with a welcome drink and asked to head for Lunch around the pool side. The walk to the Pool Side from the reception was beautiful as we got a chance to admire the beautiful grounds of the resort.   However, the resort was in dire need of staff. Expecting it to be a smoothly run buffet area I was very disappointed with a number of things-the lack of staff, quality of food and the service. There was no one to attend to you if you needed anything. The table was not well laid out and the cutlery was missing. I had to ask a couple of times before I could get a fork. The soft drinks that were served were flat and…"
538,40,"The hotel has excellent landscape, very nice pool, large clean rooms, with nice sit outs. The hotel is green with lots of facilities like sports, pool, spa etc.Although room and main area remains fresh even today, other facilties like spa, health center appears to be slowly losing its charm.The service is very nice and staff courteous. The buffet is large, but not delicious, it lacks the touch and hence I never enjoyed food inspite of large spread. The swimming pool is nice, but they don't give costumer on rent rather sell at high price, so better carry your own.Overall a nice break from daily routine."
539,20,We went this past weekend .but it failed to impress us all areas.when we reached at 10 pm and looking for food option we were told there is a itlalian resturant that we can dine in .reaching there (wa a task itself as hotel has no facility for kids strollers and my husband that to carry up and down the stairs) Resturants was closed for a company event. Next day we went for spa which though was pricey but again disappointed us.i went for pedicure n manicure.rooms are without A/C .i was expecting at least brand like lakme for nail polish but they used a local one. All n all would not recommend .yes for two day only one day we had tv in room ....most of the time there were no signals.
540,40,"We had gone here for the company outing, for a full day trip. There are enough activities for a group of people for an entire day. The food is good, service was also good. And the swimming pool is excellent. Only problem is that the place is a little far from the main city but i guess every resort has the same problem."
541,30,"Much away from Main City, Rooms away from Entry - Ask for Auto Baggy ( good its free ), Good Greenery, Good Food, Good Rooms, Expensive Room Service - Better go Restaurants, Better go for buffet instead Ala caret, Much economical, Carry your own wines (if wishes to ) to save a lot, Better Book Taxi at Call for movement"
542,40,"Nice place for a week end - not very far hour from Bangalore city just a hour's drive - resort has a great swimming pool, good room with a lovely sit out and great indoor games - food here is expensive so negotiate for room rates with all meals included.   A great place for corporate / team events"
543,30,"Stayed here for 9 nights for the exhibition at the nearby BIEC exhibition, it is a great location and only 5-10 mins away from there in the morning. The hotel is big and they use a little motorised buggy to drop you when you arrive and leave with your luggage but rest of the time you are walking to reception. I had a room at the bottom of the complex near the pool bar and where breakfast is served. The rooms are ok and beds very comfortable and they are cleaned very well each day so no issues with that. Breakfast is good and plenty to choose from and nice to sit outside in the warming sun early on. Pool is large and clean although I never had chance to use it as I was busy from early to late. I did notice there are very few sunbeds around the pool so if you wanted to spend the…"
544,20,"This hotel has beautiful grounds, but the rooms are mediocre, in need of an update, and not very clean. The service was also poor, in the restaurants and at the front desk. After pre-arranging a late checkout, they even tried to charge for an extra night.  We used this hotel for a business conference with 350 participants. I would not recommend it."
545,40,"Very friendly people's and the service is very good, rooms are quite big and all with garden view. Huge pool with nice pool bar/restaurant which is a nice place where to spend the evening. Free wi-if, satellite flat TV, complimentary water and very good food in any restaurant (3). There is also a good Italian restaurant. Very relaxing place, calm and not noisy at all. Quite far away from the city but just perfect for the international exhibition venue which is just 6km away."
546,40,The rooms were luxurious. The bathroom has got very good tub. The ambience is good. Swimmin pool is very big. Sauna bath and steam bath were very nice. It was in the package we took. Outdoor bas is pool side. The location is very nice.
547,50,Good food. The ambience is beautiful. Rooms were well appointed. Bathrooms were also well sized and done up well.   One of the largest pools.  Quite a distance from Bangalore city and from the airport.   Good place to go for a 2-3 day holiday but one should not plan to visit the city at that time. You will spend too much time traveling
548,40,"Me and my wife stayed here for a night. It was our anniversary celebration and since I stay at Bangalore, it didn't make much sense to extend our stay. According to me it is one of the best places around Bangalore to unwind in style.  It is about 25 Kms from CBD of Bangalore and has an excellent approach road (NH 4) except for the last couple of Kms. It is a 5 star resort and deserves the rating.  I loved -  1. The location - secluded from the hustle-bustle of the city, yet close enough to reach without having to drive a lot.  2. Rooms - Elegant decor, excellent amenities and beautiful patios (each room in the resort has one). The bathrooms are tastefully done and the shower is heavenly.  3. The lagoon pool - supposedly one of the largest in the country. It is the best thing…"
549,40,"Very nice place, helpful staff but untrained, little away from city, so good place to relax Very serene atmosphere lush green. Good place to relax. Good variety of food in buffet. Large pool. 42 km from airport."
550,40,"The property is located around 40kms away from bangalore and is a place where you can relax. The rooms are not worth the amount they charge for. Initially it would be a little difficult for you to find the place cuz they dont have proper signage on the main road for diversion. I stayed here for 2 days and as it was an official event, we were paid all the attention we could. Overall experience in this property was good."
551,50,"After a tiring week at office, you feel like relaxing... Add to it some reason to celebrate, to get pampered... Then ""Golden Palms"" offers you the best!  The pool is huge and lovely, its great to even lounge around at night! It has neat and clean changing rooms if you give in to its invitations...  There are lots of choices for food. We only went to the multicuisine Cafe Solaire, so can't comment much! We enjoyed the food at cafe Solaire!!  All in all a wonderful getaway from work :D"
552,40,"In fact, there were a few times where  I would say the staff was paying a bit TOO much attention.  We were there when there weren't many people around, so we were the only ones eating in the Chinese restaurant...every time we ate there, for example.  The server was VERY attentive, and very polite.  It just felt a little awkward eating with somebody standing there watching your every bite to make sure you had enough food on your plate.  I take large bites and that meant he felt like he had to come over every 4 bites to put more food on my plate.  Perhaps wealthy Indian people enjoy this, but for me it was a little bit over the top.  The guy couldn't be any more nice and helpful, though...and the food at this place (the Hidden Dragon) was VERY good.    Other than that, for the…"
553,40,"This was a quick plan for me to replace the shivasamudram falls plan due to heavy rain. But my selection was not bad.   When me and Ani started off the journey, she was in an impression that we are heading towards the falls. It was a surprise for her when the car entered the gates of the resort.  Got a warm welcome on arrival and then took us for a ride around the resort in a club car. Drizzling made the climate romantic.  We started off with squash, followed by table tennis and billiards. Then went for the dinner.  Must say the dinner was awesome and good. And loved the hospitality.  Loved the time spent in the swimming pool.   And a walk through the sprawling landscape made the perfect day out for us.  Only one thing that caused a bit of disappointment was that the plan for…"
554,50,"I have just returned from a 7 night stay at this lovely hotel. The rooms are spacious and very clean.  The huge bed was beautifully made up using high quality linen and pillows.  The staff were very attentive and always had a genuine smile to welcome you.  The hotel is situated away from the city and yes, it's a bit of a treck to get in to the centre of Bangalore. However, because its away from all the noise and dust it's a welcome relief to return to the calm of the hotel and it's beautiful gardens. The food was excellent and the extensive breakfast buffet had everything you could imagine including European and Asian cusine. Sadly, I didn't get chance to try the spa or the huge pool but I will do next time I stay, because I would be more than happy to return to this wonderful…"
555,40,"I did not stay here. But, I would love to someday.  I went here for an office conference. So, my review will be more from that perspective.  - I saw a number of big organizations holding conferences and day outs. So, I guess, this place is a favourite for those kinds of things.  - The place is very big and very beautiful. In fact, from the reception, you need a 5-6 minutes of walk to reach the food area.  - You will be surrounded by hundreds of coconut trees. Makes for a pretty sight.  - The swimming pool is a major plus point. It's a huge pool, one of Asia's biggest. You must carry your costume.  - One of the plus points is the recreation building. There, you have: Snooker/Pool, Carrom, and Table Tennis.  - They even have a tennis court.  - They even provide cycles.. good pass…"
556,40,"Just last week i landed up at the Golden Palms Hotel & Spa (came to know from colleagues that this property belongs to Sanjay Khan - Bollywood actor of yesteryears) for a corporate event. It is a expansive property, tucked away from the busy highway that has warehouses on one side, and industrial units on the other.  The hotel staff and procedures were pretty streamlined, and it seemed they were at ease to handle the check in of such a large group. The ""Seronto"" lounge is spaaciouss!! fit for holding social events.  Food was good. The best part was the stay, room was spacious with a balcony / sit-out space overlooking the inside view of the property - pool, garden, etc.   Would i like to go and spend some time with my family there? Definitely Yes!!"
557,40,"Been there for an offsite. Everything inside the resort is done nicely. The water body, landscaping, statues and others are beautifully done. I liked the room. Quite spacious. Did not like the dinner menu much but lunch was quite good. Good place to have an offsite."
558,40,we stayed quite some time back and the stay was really good and peaceful.Well maintained greenery made us comfortable.Food was also good. I feel they could have more open space having facilities for out door activities. Swimming pool is the 'most liked' in our stay period.
559,50,this place is approx 75 minutes drive from bangalore .developed by cine celebrity sanjay khan wife.an marvellous fantabulous retreat combined with superb management. 1.a visit & experience of their spa which is awesome is strongly recommanded. 2.their gaming zone provide u with choce of indoor games 3.their italian restaurent has a live phillipuno girls group dancing entertaing guest while they dine 4.common area are having roman statues and there is lot of green area.includes health club and has an excellent jogging track. 5.biggest swimming pool
560,40,"A great hotel and close the the Bangalore International exhibition centre, 5 mins by hotel taxi. A nice change to be able to sit outside at night, no pollution or noise form car horns. The rooms are clean with air con, the staff are very friendly and the restaurants are great. All good value compared to the city. Also a great spa that also good value for money. I will stay there again."
561,40,"Go there and unwind yourself. Its a sprawling resort, with wide open space and greenery everywhere, large pool. Very close and the only one near BIEC. But, tThat makes the supporting facilities expensive. The taxi took Rs. 500 for just 6 KM and 15 min. !  Breakfast is just fine ... very far off from rooms ... near the pool.  Good for corporate meetings ..."
562,50,"A must-stay resort in Bangalore.Everything is so well maintained, the food is AWESOME ~!!The massage and spa ""AWESOME""Staff and management ""AWESOME"" Loved it and surely will go back again. The management is very friendly and helpful. There are a few areas that need improvement, however every Hotel and Spa would need it. Waking up in the morning and just walking around the resort , so relaxing. Awesome Experience overall!"
563,30,"This is a good resort, but i did not feel something really amazing compared to many similar resorts.  At the same time, nothing to complain except for the long travel time though the Bangalore's highly congested & trafficy roads."
564,40,"Located at little off location , provides excellent opportunity to indulge and relax. The buffet dinner is value for money and provides excellent variety. Spread in vast expanse is worth visiting more than once. Owned by Sanjay Khan , the property is fit to accomodate large group of tourists. Added feature is it doubles up as spa, resort and hotel."
565,30,"If you come from the airport at night as we did the hotel seems very far away, taxis bringing our colleagues took anywhere from 45 mn to 90 mn. The hotel is in the countryside and a lot of drivers don't know the shortest way. When you arrive there you realise you have not done all that road for nothing. The place is an oasis with beautiful gardens and a massive swimming pool. We came for a seminar .The food was excellent and the logistics good, meeting room was spacious and clean with proper equipment. The rooms are reasonably comfortable , located in small villas around the swimming pool. The quality of the decor and craftsmanship in the rooms is ""local"" rather than international standard, but I can live with that in such a nice environment. You have a walking track around the…"
566,50,I was here for a 2N 3D package with my wife and found this to be one of the best vacations we ever had. The place is huge and well planned. The Food is awsome and well laid. The staff is well behaved and courteous. Only small issues like room telephone needed repair etc.... but overall very good experience
567,40,"I had heard about golden palms from friends. Had a chance to stay there for 3 days recently. This property is a nice one. They have 100+ rooms, asia's largest swimming pool (claimed to be), children play area, indoor games and some outdoor activities as well.  Food is average, but desserts are great. They serve close to 15 types of desserts on the buffet. Swimming pool is clean and the pool made a difference. My son was hooked to the kids pool which is 2ft deep and he enjoyed the time.  They have sauna, steam and message including fitness center. All of these were great. I got a complementary message along with sauna and steam.  Overall a nice weekend getaway from the usual huzzle buzzle and a good place to hang out with the family. The service is great, we did not have any…"

569,50,"We had been to Golden palms for family fun day on 30th.june.2012 with all my family members...The food, event, games, DJ, Philipino performance, swimming pool..all were very well organised and my family members was so happy that we love to visit again and again golden plams. The only thing which was boring was the sun's heat on that day was so hot. The overall ambience is excellent in golden palms."
570,30,"Golden palms used to be a great place to visit several years ago. Unfortunately, the quality of the place has come down tremendously. We stayed at this resort for a day and were pretty disappointed with some of the things we saw. For example, there were no bathmats in the restroom and that meant dripping water all over the floor. We had to use one of the towels to make it a mat. There were no hand towels either with paper towels being present instead. Another ecological waste if you ask us! The food in the included buffet package was not great. No doubt there was a ton of variety in the dishes. But, each one of them had something or the other missing. The food was not bad. It just wasn't delicious. The bread selection was good though. Another thing we noticed was that whenever a…"
571,50,"we were a big group and were looking out for a  nice place for the weekend with kids and this was the right place to be. The Sunday brunch was just fantastic with great value for money. the best buffet ever, pool was fabulous-clean and vast,great drinks and the service of course very courteous.we had a spa treatment which was relaxing. the whole experience was A one.If you are looking for  a  resort without having to drive too much,kids activities ,good food and best of all you come back refreshed... No regrets , only good memories!!!"
572,50,"Spent two nights and 2 days here for a conference. The conference hall, spa, swimming pool and the restaurants are top class.  The management and the staff were very helpful throughout our stay there and even offered our group 30% discount on the Spa facilities.  The meals were really great especially the lunches. I had a tough time staying awake after devouring the sumptuous lunch.  The rooms and bathrooms were well maintained and well stocked. In am now planning a short vacation with my family at this place.  i"
573,40,"Stayed with colleagues for a company event. The garden is beautifuly designed with its palms, plants, swimming pool and lovely night lighting. The room was big but standart with no work area. the bed was good but less for those who like hard mats (like myself). The facilities are good but there's a lack of attention comparing to other 5 stars center of town hotels. The service was attentive, the room was clean, yet during the cleaning of the corridors wasn't at its best (a Room service dish which was left out by one of the guest, was left out up for most of the day)."
574,30,"The hotel is located on Tumkur road and it takes an Jaipur and half to reach the hotel from bengaluru airport. The access road to the hotel is quite bumpy. Had to wait for an hour before the room was allotted. The gardens and lamdscaping need a major revamp. One of the most ill maintained gardens probably. The rooms are surrounded by a lot of greenry, but the rooms itself are not up to the mark. Cost of room service is exorbitant. Cost at spa is decent but you will have to wait for some time or it is better if you fix up an appointment. Breakfast buffet does not have much of a variety and you will need to push people to get decent food. Overall 3 on 5. "
575,50,Had gone there the last weekend with my family... out inital plan us to go towards North but as we didnt have much holidays with us decided with Golden Palms and never regretted it..... An amazing swimming pool.... loads of activites to spend your time with and the water volley ball was just amazing.....Spa is a must go..... one of the bests I must say... I travel to a lot due to my work..but this place would rate in my top 5 places to go to....Good is simply great!!! and the people there are soo helpful and amazing... Thank you guys for making my trip so memorable....
576,30,"stayed here during a corporate event. The property is good, very big and good landscape with lot of trees, especially coconut trees (with a sign board - ""beware of falling coconuts"" :)).  The rooms are decent, has all the required features... but for the money you pay i feel it is not really worth, for the same money you may find better hotels. If you plan for a weekend relax this is a good place, has a good jogging track, big swimming pool, good bar rest of the time can relax in the room.  The food was not very good, except the buffet breakfast it was really good and wide range of options.  Overall its good stay, but there are better places available for the same cost!"
577,10,"Very bad service.  When we arrived in the room there were no spoons, towels, teabags, milk or nothing in minibar,  For the amount of money we pay the rooms were not that great.  I would never recommend anyone to go there.  Very disappointing.  There are much better places to stay in.  The lights and tv were broken in the room."
578,30,The hotel is in dilapidated condition. The rooms are still OK and has been upgraded to having a LCD TV. The bathrooms however had a defective shower (Room No.103). The cofee shop had a bad smell to it and we had to sit ourdoors. The outdoor area had no fans (The hotel is still living in the era when Bangalore has year round good weather). The swimming pool was fantastic and very tempting. The food was very mediocore. The play room had all the ameneties but again the air conditioning had broken down and the heat was unbearable. The lift to 2nd floor of the conference room was broken and we had to walk up. They need renovation big time.
579,50,It was a great experience as we had gone for a wedding and had 2 nights & 3days stay. All things were well organized. Especially hotel staff was very courteous all family had a great fun & enjoyed. had a great weekend.
580,30,"The hotel was probably once grand but has been badly maintained and managed. Staff are good and English standard very good. The buildings are quite large but signage poor so often difficult to find places, even the gym has no signs. It is a long way from central Bangalore and is set in an industrial area (although no impact on the hotel) so if not dining in the hotel its about an hour to get to somewhere decent. The hotel has a jogging track around it (800m) a half way decent gym and a great pool."
581,50,"We booked Golden Palms for day outing for our team! Starting from booking to event organizing, Golden Palms team helped us out.  Compare to other high profile resorts, I felt Golden Palms is very well maintained resort.  Security was bit strict with the swimming pool dress code, I felt they need to be more realistic.  Lots of options for playing games ranging from tennis, cricket,table tennis, etc.  Yummy food and good service.  I'll certainly consider it again."
582,30,"The hotel grounds are beautiful. The rooms are clean but not spectacular. The word ""spa"" should be taken out at it is not a ""spa"" hotel. The hotel in secluded and not close to anything. You must eat at one of the three restaurants and they all have the same service... poor and untimely. If you need anything at this hotel you have to go to the front desk which can be quite a hall since the property is so vast. I still give it 3 stars but won't stay here for business again. definately a LIESURELY hotel"
583,20,"I have stayed here on a number of occasions and each time it gets a bit worse.  Hair in the soap tray, no power base for the dirty old kettle are standard but this time they introduced a new fun item where your room key won't work and you have to always walk to reception to ask someone to come and open the door. Considering the open layout of the rooms this is a long way! They where not full and could have changed my room to solve the issue but choose to just shrug. Internet acesss is a joke. Just don't stay here if you are on business it's bad and getting worse"
584,50,"This is the place one should visit when at bangalore.Nice swimming pools for adults and kids, facilities for sports activities, Several Restaurants, Bars, etc. Several packages are available for the visitors. I visited this Resort in the month of August 2011 1st week, with my better half and daughter, she booked the resort for us she is serving at bangalore Oracle."
585,50,"The property in Tumkur road is probably one of the best.Great services,amenities are best and the pool is just amazing.Also should not miss out on a spa.The staffs are courteous and helpful,rooms are clean and spacious.Perfect for a getaway."
586,30,"We stayed here while participating in an exhibition at BIEC on Tumkur Road. It is the only decent hotel close by BIEC which is on the outskirts of Bangalore. The rates were reasonable for a 5 star but unfortunately my opinion is that they are no more than a 4 star.  I must say that the infrastructure is excellent. They have a lovely setting of a tropical resort within a city. The rooms are spacious with balconies overlooking the biggest pool I have seen in India. I am not sure about their claim that it is the biggest in the world but it is big!  The breakfast buffet is very good and what I would expect in a 5 star with plenty of options and live stations. We even had the pleasure of being greeted good morning by Sanjay Khan, Bollywood star and owner, but I didn't know who he was…"
587,50,"I have stayed here 7 times in the last year, once I found this hotel I won't stay anywhere else. Rooms are so wonderful, very comfortable, but even better than the room is the people, they are just so helpful and friendly. They make my stay so easy and because of them I love this hotel."
588,40,"A property owned by Actor Sanjay Khan's family , Golden Palms is known as the place where Actor Hritik Roshan got married to Suzanne Roshan.  Golden Palms is outside Bangaluru city and is perhaps the biggest property i have ever seen as a resort. It is a huge and extremely beautiful place. We had a conference there and the place just set our mood there.  Travelling In baggis, to playing outdoor sports and partying hard. It is a diffrent world out there. Extremely good service, good food and an world class experience. A great break from a monotomous hotels and  resorrts otherwise nearby. The spa serivce is also great.  A great stressbuster and relaxing destination. Must go"
589,50,"Stepped in after years for their Sunday Brunch and hey it was nice! From the moment I walked thru’ the front doors…I could feel the difference  Seated next to a lagoon shaped swimming pool and it's inviting blue waters set amidst with gardens, bridges and very lush landscaping. Paradise! A poolside barbecue along with variety of live stations serving most mouth watering finger bites, there was even a special kiddie’s cart.. interesting After a long lazy sunny afternoon at the Aqua bar with DJ playing retro! [my requests] decided to move indoors to embark on a feast of Western and Asian delicacies with a range of seafood, lamb & chicken. The food spread was exciting prepared perfectly! My entire fiesta ended only after devouring on the sumptuous choice of mouth-watering desserts…"
590,20,"Very good ambience and location. Very good food, Biggest swimming pool and nice gardens. BUT- the rooms and the conference rooms are very badly maintained. The curtains and carpets stink- musty. Good staff but poorly managed property. Fish was very good- both gravy and dry."
591,40,"Stayed at the resort for 4 nights.. Great Ambience, Superb buffet spread, Elaborate activities... A Receptionist (who becomes a female dog) as soon as you check out!! She called my number in her blindness and thought i was the Sales Manager!!! LOL"
592,30,"Potentially a great haven but far too pricey for moderate priced travellers. There was no free Internet access, Wifi was very expensive at 600 INR per day and breakfast was 1000INR per couple. Beer was also expensive at 275INR  and Indian spirits costing 360 INR. The resort is 22Km from Bangalore and there is no inexpensive easy access to the city. A taxi to the resort from the airport cost 2000 INR. a taxi to the city on average costs 1500 INR. Sorry to go on about the cost of everything but we just didn't expect it. Pretty resort, excellent gym and spa, lovely setting, pool and gardens, front desk staff were ok, one offered a personal touch and went out of their way to accommodate our needs, but apart from that nothing stood out and we have no desire to return there in a…"
593,30,"Its a nice place for elderly people to take rest. Nothing to rave about, if u go with lot of expection then u will be disappointed. They can make the place much much better."
594,50,"Am from an R D Burman Foundation called Euphony and for one of our shows we had with his original musicians,Golden Palms was our Hospitality partner and we had one of the most amazing experience.Customer Service is something that other hotels should learn from them.You name it and its there.We had very old musicians with us and the hotel ensured they get utmost comfort.The Lobby managers Ajay,Arun and Inayat were always at your service.A special mention should be made of Mr Sandeep Muralidharan and Atoshi Roy who ensured we were provided with all facilities.Infact the Rehearsel venue was provided to us instantly by Mr Sandeep,without which the show would not have been possible.I would recommend this hotel to all corporates since am a corporate as well."
595,40,"With high expectations, my husband and I made a trip to Golden Palms on a Sunday. And it turned out to be a perfect day with memories to cherish. The lush landscape instantly relaxes your soul. As we began exploring the hotel, we realised that a day trip is simply too short to experience its true character. The stress buster spa package followed by the flavourful Sunday brunch was an ideal start. A relaxing afternoon by the poolside and a refreshing swim  was an ideal end. A short but sweet and unforgettable getaway. We are definitely coming back for more such treats!"
596,40,I had gone their with my wife for our honeymoon.... It was an amazing experience.... We were initially planning for Goa or someplace like that but due to time constraint opted out for Golden Palms and never regretted the decision..... the ambiance is beautiful... its spread across a huge area with a large beautiful swimming pool.... and a homely and courteous staff and their spa is one to look out for..... Would surely recommend to all ..... Its a must Visit...
597,40,"For the past 2 years our Annual Sales Kickoffs have been held at GP. A picturesque resort with well organized meeting venue, comfortable rooms and food,  each experience has been a good one."
598,40,"Was there on Sunday for their 'Awadhi' food festival.The place itself  has a very inviting welcome about it,but what took us on a real high was the food! It was simply BRILLIANT.I'M A Restaurateur myself and i think i know good food when i taste it.The starters were the real,authentic 'Awadhi'stuff.There were absolute rarities like Taftaan,Sheermal,et al. I  found out that actual chefs were flown down from Lucknow,and that was the secret of Success.Now THAT'S the way to hold a festival..Congratulations to the Management!I'm definitely going back.."
599,10,"we went for marriage party yesterday, Bride and Groom father might have paid huge sum to arrange the marriage party ( reception), But this Golden Palms managemnt made us feel like beggers....After long q, we will get one pani puri....and there is huge crowd at buffet table...so we came back home with out food.  SO please dont arrange any marriage party here....they will make sure invites feel like beggers and most of the people will with out food and they can save huge amount of money."
600,30,"A generally tired looking hotel, past it's best. Unfortunately the reality is not as good as the marketing. The food was average at best. The kids club had no attendant or organised activities and was deserted as a result. The wireless internet was intermittent. I was just here for the weekend, but I'm sure you must be able to find better hotels around here."
601,40,The hotel is in outskirt of Bangalore on a large property. Well maintained garden and large swimming pool to spend time. Has well maintained facilities of indoor and outdoor games. Good restaurants to have food. Rooms are stinking due to bad carpets  Bed bugs found in bed spoiling sleep
602,40,"Had been to the Golden Palms resort on a business weekend.  The lobby entrance is set in elegant style with high walls and warm lighting. The swimming pool is a delight to the eye, and is supposed to be the largest in India.  Luxurious and Spacious rooms, clean although not as good as the lobby sets your expectations to be . The reception staff aren't very proactive, however there werent any complaints with their service.  The food section is the best! There is a large variety and you'll find yourself spoilt for choice! There is not only variety but the taste is first-class as well!  Ample greenery and fountains,  the large and clean swimming pool and great food is what you can look out for."
603,50,"Well maintained hotel & spa situated away from the city crowd. Amazing view of nature plus there swimming pool experience was mind boggling,most of their rooms have got amazing view with best cooling system even the restrooms were kept very clean, overall i must say i would love to stay here whenever i get a chance to be in  Bangalore ...must visit place if you r in Bangalore."
604,40,"I stayed at the hotel during our attendance to an event at Bangalore International Exhibition Centre (BIEC). This hotel is just 10 minutes by car from there, so it is very convenient to avoid traffic chaos to reach BIEC from city center. Public transport is not an option from the hotel, so it is better to ask for car service (quite expensive) or contacting a taxi yourself.  Gardens and swimming pool are very nice, well kept and huge; spa is perfect to recover after jet-lag. Nevertheless, forget about swimming pool at night, or you may take a swim with lots of little “insect friends”.  I had really good luck and I was upgraded to a suite, in the room you feel like a princess. Room service is good enough, although personal at front desk are not very helpful neither nice.  Food at…"
605,20,"We booked ourselves at Golden Palms for our anniversary celebrations and stayed from 29 April to 06 May 2011. The property is excellent with a Huge Swimming pool(claimed to be the biggest in South Asia) around which 150 rooms are built.  The rooms are small in size for a resort of that size and the furnishing and facilities can be rated just about average. It was raining for three nights out of seven we stayed there and we requested for umbrellas , we were told they cannot provide umbrellas as they do not have enough , however they have offered to send the golf cart. I requested a friend of mine for giving me his bike to go around Bangalore. The hotels security refused to let me park the bike in the hotel premises( they have a parking lot which can easily fit in 200 vehicles).…"
606,40,"Was part of a business delegation here for a weekend. The place is very well done with large rooms, lots of greens and a comfortable and quiet atmosphere. The staff is courteous and takes care of everything you need. It tends to get busy over the weekends with all the bangalore companies heading out there for events which makes the overall stay cumbersome - log queues at the buffet makes eating breakfast a dash at the train as opposed to a fresh dose of morning. The lunch and dinner is the same ordeal. They should have a separate counter/area for company buffets to ensure there is some decorum maintained there. The food quality is average. The rooms should have better internet connectivity considering the number of business travelers the hotel receives and also they should have…"
607,30,"Had stayed last weekend there, location, the rooms and the facilities was pretty good, but the house keeping services were bad, room was not cleaned ontime, had to ask for water at least for 3 times before they brought it to the room"
608,40,"We went with a team of about 30 people for a business retreat. The facilities are very important, sufficient enough to allow you to concentrate on business meetings in day, opulent enough to allow you to relax. On house breakfast, lunch & dinner were really sumptuous. The best part is the really big pool they have. The rooms booked by us were pretty ok, considering the fact that most of the time was spent in meeting rooms"
609,10,"We are the organizers of Miss queen of India and we happened to do the prestigious event out there. To be frank, we paid 50 % in advance for the rooms, food, etc... We reached there by 12.00 Sharp. Till 3 pm we were asked to sit at the lobby and no one was there to take care of our customers even after we paid such a bulk amount.  At last we got 2 rooms and instead of 12 rooms and 1 presidential suite. After the horrible waiting and hunger we went to restarunt and got a hand written menu that too we had to pay them additional. There was no co-operation from the staff out there. The hospitality is the worst that one could ask for in this sector. we had some respect for Mr. Khan that's why we prefereed this one.   We had  done more than 2000 shows but never ever experienced this…"
610,10,With lots of expectation we reached this remote hotel at tumkur road to see cops hunting for stolen gold as we entered. we waited 2 hours to check into our room though we had prior booking. they had excuses as the room has not yet cleaned and so on. At last at  2.50 we got our rooms and then told that complimentary lunch is ready at cafe solare. we went and asked for the buffet menu and a all hindi speaking fellow came with apeice of  hand written folded paper in which some names of dishes were scribbled and informed that the buffet is not set on the table. we ordered what ever the fellow told was availble just as in a dhaba. The 'world largest swimming pool' at the spa had dead spiders and toads so that none of the guest dared to get in. The property is so large and good but…
611,40,The Golden Palms Resort is around 90 mins from the Airport & around 45 mins from Bangalore city Center. The moment you enter you feel relaxed. The entire resort is amidst ample greenery & is spread around quite a bit. It’s not your usual Hotel which is based out of a building. The Resort has blocks which are 1 storey & have around 10-15 rooms on a floor. We stayed in B3 which is a bit away from the lobby & restaurants but has an awesome view of the pool. With that I must mention that the Pool is just awesome. They claim it’s the biggest Pool in the World. I don’t know if that’s quite true but it is huge. The Pool is the highlight of the hotel & everything is spread around the Pool.   The rooms are of top quality with the best amenities that one can ask for. The service does get…
612,40,"Average Experience, not that exciting though ! Seemed to be little less than the worth ! Had heard a lot about it, but did not find it that great, and the room service is not at all good. Have a Big Swimming Pool and a good lawn. Food is Good. Quite Far from the city.."
613,30,The first thing that strikes you about Golden Plams is the ghastly ambience. There is too much of everything - whether it is the surfeit of trees or the huge swimming pool. The rooms are very average and it is just not value for money. Angsana Spa which is nearby offers much better value for money. The food was the only saving grace
614,40,"I went to Golden Palms twice in Oct for off-site programs. I was returning there after a couple of years. The ambience has been maintained the same. The buffet spread at Cafe Solaire on all days across breakfast, lunch and dinner was excellent. The room was spacious - good for the twin sharing that we had planned. The facilities are good - swimming pool, gym and games area. Didn't use the spa this time so can't comment on whether the standard has been maintained. Getting there can be a bit of a pain since the flyover has been completed but not yet inauguarated. The last stretch of 1.5 km has always been pretty bad."
615,40,"We had conducted a two day business training event at this hotel. The venue was great and the ambiance simply superb. We couldn't spend much time to enjoy the various facilities like the spa etc, but we had good time at the pool, and at the 3 cafes they have and of course, the bar. Also, the management claims the pool is the biggest in Asia and it probably is.   The food was specially arranged for us for supper and so, it was definitely good. Even the complimentary breakfast, and the buffet lunch were great. Various cuisines to suit everyone's palette and if you have time, you can get complimentary relaxation message at the spa.  There are many business centers also available and we used a normal sized one, enough for about 30 people. The place is perfect for trainings and the…"
616,30,"If you are a foodie, then it’s not the place for you, if you are a pure vegetarian then forget. This was the place my company chose for an offsite meet. This is on tumkur road from Bangalore, quite away from the busy life of city.  All south Indian and north Indian food tasted differently missing their original taste. My non vegetarian colleagues were also not happy with the food.  All other things were good. it’s a nice place away from Bangalore, cool, calm and peaceful. The swimming pool here is quite large and we thoroughly enjoyed our games of water polo."
617,40,"We visited this resort for a business meeting. Located at about 30 km from Bangaloru city on the outskirt of Tumkur Road. It has an excellent landscaping. Large rooms are facing towards the biggest (as claimed by the management) swiming pool and very close to the mother nature. Although name is ""Golden Palm"" but actually has golden coconut trees through out the resort. One can relax forgetting the busy city life. There are excellent outdoor and indoor games, spa, 800m jogging track, gymnasium etc. facilities.   Food is not very tasty and also repeatative within a day. Room, house keeping service is also not up to the mark. Several follow ups are to be made for simple service. Banquet hall is not maintained (stuffy). Staff needs training. Location and atmosphere is very conducive…"
618,50,"We organised a 4 day manager training programme at Golden Palms resort and true to its name- this place is top class. from the swimming pool to conference facilities to roome- everything is luxurious. Service is top class and the restaurant is really good. in addition the place offers additional options - like a lounge bar, spa etc. Although we had a hectic time with the training programme organised, evenings were pleasant due to the beautiful landscape of the resort and top class amenities.  All in all a great place- makes you want to go again and again. No wonder its the favourite destination for politicians and celebrities!"
619,20,"Having stayed at this hotel earlier in the year I put of the poor front desk service as one of those things but this time it was proven to be the worst aspect of the stay. The hotel is a good location for the business being conducted and the actual waiters were very helpful and nice. The same thing let it down and the reason for writing is that I was disgusted. The first night there I had no towels, just a hand towel. My customer had a room that had a waste bin in that had not been emptied.  The second night having complained about the towels, I had a bath towel and no hand towels this time.  The worstr aspect is checking out. No matter how many staff are on duty they cant deal with one customer. Check out took 35 minutes and they could not even find confirmation receipts to…"
620,20,Location convenient for us to avoid traffic when on business. Rooms large. No bath. Tired and 1980's decor. Some concerns on safety in rooms. Stayed in 245 and in bathroom electrics made tidy with black tape in lamps. In bedroom lamp electrics exposed. When on balcony if you accidently close door behind you you are locked out of your room. Rate was £150 ish per night no breakfast included. Checkout was a disaster taking over half hour and incorrect billing to room. Will be looking for alternative when next in Bangalore on business.  
621,10,"Hey guys, this week we a group of 7 guys went off to the famous Golden-Palm resort, Bangalore for a get-together. And by far we had the most displeasing situation there, we just get surrounded by mobs.   We reached there by 4 pm and went straight to the gaming section, and then to the pool, and the evening was passed sitting in the pool-side bar. Some of us again went to try their hands in the games. There the problem started, the game-attendees told them that one of their colleagues has lost money in that area and since there were no other outsiders than us, they enquired if we took the same. We had no clue what was happening and replied negatively and left the place to join the other guys in the pool-side. After sometime their head-security guy, who was informed by the…"
622,50,"The place is very quiet, off Bangalore on Tumkur road. Service is very good, food is excellent. Huge swimming pool is very well maintained. The 800 meter jooging track is a good motivation to get up early. Overall it gives a fantastic holiday experience."
623,30,"I have been planning to visit this hotel for aong term---was looking forward to the visit.  But unfortunately my first experience was not so good. Hope the next time will be better.  It started with the tiresome long journey to the resort.   even though I got to stay in alpana suite, the second problem encountered was no lights on the corridor of the floor---found difficult to use the key card in the pitch darkness. Third problem was more serious---complete muddy water from the shower---effect of heavy rains on that day in Bangalore.  Next issue--no cable TV due to digging of roads in the near abouts of the resort.  Overall not an experience to remember"
624,40,"When you seek a hotel close to Bangalore International Exhibition Centre, Golden Palms is THE choice. Just a 10-15 minutes ride from the exhibition ground it allows you to avoid the huge Bangalore traffic jams. The hotel itself is a calm oasis with a great swimming pool and three nice restaurant (the poolside barbecue being the most atmospheric). Room price has been a bit high (ongoing trade show made demand soar, I suppose) but still okay."
625,40,"This is a beautiful property! Lush grounds, a huge swimming pool, and all kinds of facilities that a real spa-resort should have. It's quite amazing to see such a serene, green place just a few minutes outside the urban sprawl and chaos of Bangalore city - one turn off the highway and it's like you've entered a different world.  I was there with a group of almost 50 colleagues for a business planning weekend, so naturally the staff was very attentive.  The conference facilities were very good and we faced no hiccups with any of our arrangements.  I would say that the highlight of the resort is the swimming pool (they claim it's the largest in the world, but I wouldn't take their word for it). It's crystal clear, spotlessly clean, and it's inviting blue waters are set amidst the…"
626,30,"Wonderful property, really big ,  Since not many visitors , affecting service, food quality etc."
627,30,I recently stayed at the Golden Palms Hotel in Bangalore for a weekend trip with my office colleagues.  The location of this hotel is very bad..its just 30 kms from Bangalore but the roads are so bad and full of traffic that it took us 1.5 hrs to reach there..!  The rooms are ok..nothing great..the facilities are good..swimming pool is huge (probably the largest in Asia) and the gym is also quite nice..The food was quite bad..with both the buffet lunch and dinner being very average..The breakfast was quite nice though :-)  Overall an ok. stay.nothing great..the place is too hyped and not worth the money if you are paying ;-)
628,40,"I travelled to this resort for a company conference and stayed there for 2-3 days.   This resort is owned by the Film Director Sanjay Khan. This is place where Hrithik Roshan and Suzanne Khan(Sanjay Khan's Daughter) wedding took place. Needless to say, it is one of the finest and luxurious resorts in Bangalore.  It was very green and had nice walkways. It boasted of a very big swimming pool and plush fitness centre. It is also famous for its Spa. This resort is a very good weekend break from the rush and madness of Bangalore. It is located off Tumkur Road and is around 40kms from Bangalore.  For our business meetings, it had several large conference rooms with very good service."
629,10,DATE-31 MAY 2010 Westayed in golden palmfor1night. IT is very bad experienced there. We had booking for 2 nights. Bt we cheak out in 1 day. Hotel had nice property but no   HOSPITALLITY. WORLDS LARGEST POOL but no TOWELS. NICE FOOD but NO WAITERS FOR SERVING.
630,40,"I have been to Golden Palms, Bangalore along with collegues during our bank's yearly meet. Although the place is approx. 25-30 Kms from city and about 60 Kms from airport but is peacful.  Property is huge and is spread over 1 sq. Km (that what i heard from people there). Rooms were specious and of 4 star category.   The quality and variety of food / drinks was absolutely great. Swimming pool, jaquzi, soana bath was great pleasure for the people like me using it for first time in life. We had a DJ both the nights that was of good statndard.   Overall it was a pleasent experience being there."
631,40,"THE hotel is the best i've ever seen for spa. Here the service for food and brevg is also too good. the greenary and tnd the nature scenery is just awesome. but if you are going for business purposes, it is a little inconvinient because of the distance from city. Food quality is good and for evening or morning walk , there is a beautiful park. I WILL DEFINITELY SUGGEST THIS ONE TO PEOPLE GOONG TO B'LORE FOR LEISURE. AND U SHOULD PUPOSEFULLY VISIT IT ONCE"
632,40,I have enjoyed the stay with my friends during weekends. Enjoyed a lot in lagoon saped swimming pool.
633,40,the fact that in last 1 year i have been to this place for 3 times still does not bore me if i have to go one more time to golden palms....I should say this place is located at a very remote place but once ur in the resort its really great...I really liked the huge swimming pool which they claim is one of the biggest in asia and it really is big...The garden is really well maintained which gives a great view from any room..The conference facilities were also very good..The food quality was not great but decent...the best place to be is the poolside bar in the evening...!!
634,40,GOlden palms is an excellent overall experiance .. the building and landscaping is quite good and the food was also excellent. The resort is well maintained and the cleanliness is a positive point.  .
635,20,"When we arrived at the hotel, it appeared to be nice and clean and well maintained, and was very welcoming. Our room was ready straight away, and we were taken straight up to it.The aspects I liked about the hotel were the lovely, well planted gardens and the large elliptical shaped swimming pool, which made a nice change from the usual rectangular variety. The gym was also very good - large and with a lot of new equipment. The food was nice and did not make me ill, which is always a bonus for a foreigner.Unfortunately, the aspects I did not like, outweigh the ones I did like. When we were first shown to our table in the restaurant, I noticed a blob of used chewing gum that someone had spat out on one of the side plates, so the waiter showed us to another table. Whilst we were…"
636,30,This hotel is about an hour drive from Bangalore city center. The biggest attraction of this resort is its SPA and the Pool...Both are just fabulous...  The resort is nicely made...rooms are elegant (do go for suites as they are much more spacious and nicer). The food is average...make sure you include it in your package as else the buffet is very expensive.      Also you have a small garden in front of room where you can sit and relax.  Overall a nice weekend getaway
637,10,"The hotel location is probably the only advantage if you have to be staying or driving to  outskirts of Bangalore near Hubli or that side of the Tumkur road ... Other than that after 4 times of stay, I can only say, you will only stay there if you have to. Even if they offer a free week of holiday stay, make sure you refuse, it could only be the ticket to your worst holiday... The rooms are dirty, hardly maintained, for a room rate of 130 - 150 USD per night (Cheap rate for India stays) I believe you will be having a chance to live closer to the nature by having all sorts of insects in your room (mosquitos, spiders, cocoroches), lice an bed bugs might be bonus top of that.... be aware... your requests trying to get internet password for Wi-Fi might be answered with "" 5 passwords…"

Fantastic amenities, great food and out of the world rooms makes this a heavenly…"
639,30,"A resort / spa which should be visited only during weekdays cause most of the weekends there are mariiage or corporate parties which might ruin your holiday in a jiffy.  The rooms are lovely, great property for a 2 night stay. Gigantic Pool.  Good service, and the most elite of the hotel staff in Bengaluru resorts.  A celebs hangout."
640,50,We went as a group of 16 of us from our family and had a wonderful time here. The resort is sheer opulence.   Friendly and helpful staff all over makes you stay very pleasant.  The buffets are lavish and the quality of food served there is absolutely wonderful.  The indoor games complex is well equipped and helps pass wonderful hours.  The swimming pool is huge and very well maintained. Did not swim too much as it was cold.  I have stay at this resort several times and enjoy myself more adn more each time I go there.
641,50,"Wow. Amazing, Cleaniness, Superb swimming pool, ample play area, nice indoor games, excellent food....."
642,30,The hotel was close to the convention center and is a good place to stay for a couple nights.  I did not use the massage facility but the workout facility was nice.    
643,50,I was there in Golden Palms on a business meeting. I must say this is one of the finest Hotel & Spa in and around Bangalore. Around 45mins journey from Bangalore City this Hotel is located. You can go there over a weekend for a great time and relaxation. This resort is really huge and they have one of the best and biggest swiming pool. I would recommend this place to everyone.
644,10,This hotel has turned into a commercial marriage party hotel. I have been staying in this hotel for 3 nights - on two of these nights the hotel had a marriage party and a corporate party with all kinds of music blaring at full volume till well over 11 pm - that is by no means a heavenly spa resort !!! My requests to the front desk fell on deaf ears - I think all they care is to make money by hosting parties !! This is not by any means a quiet hotel for a business traveller who needs to sleep in time for a hectic day ahead ....

The property is spread over many acres of land and it’s got all the modern luxuries that you can imagine of.  There’s loads of greenery around and it has claimed to have the world’s largest swimming pool, which is a delight to see.

The gym, steam and sauna, massage centre, pool etc.  The studio bar is a complete replica of a bollywood studio.   Food too is excellent."

Toilet could have been a bit larger. Most attractive things were outdoor. It reminded me of the hotel in Bali, at much larger scale. Same kind of arrangement in 2 storied buildings on both sides of garden and the swimming pool at the end. Only thing that can be dampner is the cost of food and beverages! Keep deep pockets while going here!"

653,30,Its such a wonderful place when it comes to facilities but not service. You need to wait for an hour before the receptionist gives you your room key. Bar menu is on the expensive side. The hotel staff is a bit reluctant on wishing the guests. The spa facilities are good as is the swimming pool.
654,40,"It was fabulous Trip with my colleagues. After grilling session on Buiness in Banglore we went to this property to relax . Property which is located outside the Banglore city is really one of the best Resorts . There romms , amibenec and SPAs are very good. Especially there swimming pool and messaging was fabulous. Very Nice exeperence. Plan to visit with my family."
655,30,"We checked in here for 3 days, whilst exhibiting at the nearby Bangalore Exhibition centre.  Firstly, the hotel is in a very poor area of bangalore - which is fine as long as you don't want to travel outside the gates. The drive to the hotel was along very rough roads, and it was quite some way from the airport. The traffic was just incredible !  We booked 3 nights in the Presidential suite. The rooms were very big, 2 seperate bedrooms each with large ensuites, and a very large lounge.  Although everything was clean, it did need a spruce up. Walls needed painting, bathroom needed re-grouting - that kind of stuff. Certainly not presidential standard. However, very nice.  The suites are at almsot at the end of the complex, and a good 500m walk from reception, so make use of the…"
656,50,"We visited Bangalore for the third time and this hotel was like paradise on earth. very friendly employees and good management. The Hotel is a 7 star one with exellent restaurants and sporting facilities. Laying in the quit part of Bangalore without any polution. We stayed for 15 days an all the days we enjoy staying very very much! With the nicest and largest swimmingpoole in Asië !! This is the best place to be and worthwile. The only problem is, that the hotel is one hour from the city-centre. But, therefore you will be granted with heaven on earth. Family A.R.L.M. Smit, Holland "
657,30,"The hotel is not a 5 star, but is far better than other hotels that I have stayed in India. I rate it a 3-4. The hotel is isolated about an hour away from Bangalore in an industrial area. If you want convenience to Bangalore this isn't the place. The hotel and grounds are fenced, the grounds are nicely landscaped with a large pool. The pool area is showing its age but is kept clean. The rooms are large and clean. The hotel staff was very friendly.  The italian restaurant on site was very good. "
658,10,"Hello             I am farook, one of my favourite hobbies is to holiday when ever i get the time.           One fine evening I got a call from these guys asking me come over for a presentation. I did just that as I really like when someone invites me particulartly to an outskirt as bangalore has very little fresh air left.          After the 60 minute drive I got out of the car and was greeted by the hotel lobbly customer service. They offered me a seat and requested me to wait for some time. In the duration I felt extremely dizzy and asked for a cup of tea not realising what was happening. As time weny by I got more and more dizzy. Finally after a few minutes I was asked to come along for a presentation into a room. The polite person took us into a ac room where recovered…"
659,10,This Hotel is the worst I have come across so far in my 15 years of travelling around the world.  I have lived in some hotels which were badly managed but this one takes the cake. If you want to break up your marriage take your spouse on a holiday to this hotel. It lookd good from far but is very far from good. The moment I landed into the hotel I saw a lobby which gave ma a bad vibe the staff looked sad and morose. I said to myself well what am I getting into. The room was dirty and shabby worse than a motel room. The pool was large and good but I dared not enter it just thinking if it was dirty like the rest of the hotel. The GYM is well equipped and large but the SPA is a fake they should have their spa licence taken off or atleast not allowed to operate. The room boys double…
